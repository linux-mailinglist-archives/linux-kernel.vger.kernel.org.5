I noticed them too during review. I think it would be safe to make the
changes in other two places as well such that in future we never
trip over such overlooked overflow bugs.

IMO, we don't need pa_end() and fex_end() at all. In several places in
ext4 we always have taken care by directly typecasting to avoid
overflows. Also it reads much simpler rather to typecast in place than
having a helper function which is also not very elegant due to a third
parameter. Hence I think we should drop those helpers.

Thanks once again for catching the overflows and coming up with a
easy reproducer. I am surprised that this bug was never caught with LTP,
fstests, smatch static checker.
How did you find it? :)

So the cost of this is increased IO and swap storage, correct? Is this a big
problem in practice? i.e. do you see a lot of partially mapped large folios in
your workload? (I agree the proposed fix below is simple, so I think we should
do it anyway - I'm just interested in the scale of the problem).

Yes mine too. I would only expect the ptes that map the folio will get replaced
with swap entries? So I would expect it to be safe. Although I understand the
concern with the extra swap consumption.

I'm not sure we need this - the folio's presence on the split list will tell us
everything we need to know I think?

Yes, agreed. I think there is still chance of a race though; Some other thread
could be munmapping in parallel. But in that case, I think we just end up with
the increased IO and swap storage? That's not the end of the world if its a
corner case.

I'm not sure we need the different tests for pmd_mappable vs !pmd_mappable. I
think presence on the deferred list is a sufficient indicator that there are
unmapped subpages?

I'll incorporate this into my next version.

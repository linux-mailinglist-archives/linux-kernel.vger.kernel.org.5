Slackware doesn't provide acpidump AFAIK but it was easy enough to compile
from tools/power/acpi/tools/acpidump within the 5.15.72 tree I'd used
previously to build 5.15.72 (the kernel that's currently running).  However,
running

  acpidump -b

resulted in a segmentation fault.  The root cause is line 339 in vsnprintf()
in utprint.c.  With a workaround in place a functional acpidump was
obtained.  I can provide further information from my analysis if it's
appropriate and you're interested.

For completeness I then tried the acpica source from Intel (version
20230628).  The acpidump from this worked fine, and the files produced were
identical to those from my fixed kernel-tree acpidump.  A tarball of these
is now attached to the Bugzilla report.  Curiously enough, the corresponding
vsnprintf() line in the Intel acpica source distribution matches that in the
5.15.72 source.  Perhaps the compiler flags in the Intel package happen to
prevent the segfault condition occurring at runtime for me.

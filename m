I agree it should also stop writeback due to the limit.

Note that a knob like this is still useful even when zswap space is
decoupled from disk swap slots. We still are using disk swap broadly
in the fleet as well, so a static ghost file setup wouldn't be a good
solution for us. Swapoff with common swapfile sizes is often not an
option during runtime, due to how slow it is, and the destabilizing
effect it can have on the system unless that's basically completely
idle. As such, we expect to continue deploying swap files for physical
use, and switch the zswap-is-terminal knob depending on the workload.

The other aspect to this is that workloads that do not want the
swapout/swapin overhead for themselves are usually co-located with
system management software, and/or can share the host with less
latency sensitive workloads, that should continue to use disk swap.

Due to the latter case, I wonder if a global knob is actually
enough. More likely we'd need per-cgroup control over this.

[ It's at this point where the historic coupling of zswap to disk
  space is especially unfortunate. Because of it, zswap usage counts
  toward the memory.swap allowance. If these were separate, we could
  have easily set memory.zswap.max=max, memory.swap.max=0 to achieve
  the desired effect.

  Alas, that ship has sailed. Even after a decoupling down the line it
  would be difficult to change established memory.swap semantics. ]

So I obviously agree that we still need to invest in decoupling zswap
space from physical disk slots. It's insanely wasteful, especially
with larger memory capacities. But while it would be a fantastic
optimization, I don't see how it would be an automatic solution to the
problem that inspired this proposal.

We still need some way to reasonably express desired workload policy
in a setup that supports multiple, simultaneous modes of operation.

Yeah, this is a concern. It's not such a big deal if it's only a few
pages, and we're still shrinking the footprint on aggregate. But it's
conceivable this can happen systematically with some datasets, in
which case reclaim will drive up the memory consumption and cause
OOMs, or potentially deplete the reserves with PF_MEMALLOC and cause
memory deadlocks.

This isn't something we can reasonably accept as worst-case behavior.

That should work. Once zswap has exclusive control over the page, it
is free to muck with its lru linkage. A lower bit tag on the next or
prev pointer should suffice to distinguish between struct page and
struct zswap_entry when pulling stuff from the list.

We'd also have to teach vmscan.c to hand off the page. It currently
expects that it either frees the page back to the allocator, or puts
it back on the LRU. We'd need a compromise where it continues to tear
down the page and remove the mapping, but then leaves it to zswap.

Neither of those sound impossible. But since it's a bigger
complication than this proposal, it probably needs a new cost/benefit
analysis, with potentially more data on the problem of LRU inversions.

Thanks for your insightful feedback, Yosry.

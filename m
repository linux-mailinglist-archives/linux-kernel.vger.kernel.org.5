Hi Mario

Following up on our last conversation, I purchase some hardware to
attempt to retrieve outputs from serial port. Finally, I bought another
mother board in used market which provides serial port from Super I/O
chip (ASUS TUF Gaming X570-Plus). However, I have retrieved no helpful
outputs yet when encountering the system reboot.

As you mentioned, I check whether PCIe AER is enabled or not in the
running kernel (Ubuntu 23.04 linux-image-6.2.0-37-generic). It is
certainly enabled, however I can see nothing in the output as I noted.

I experienced extra troubles relevant to AMD Ryzen machine and the issued
PCIe device:

* ASRock X570 Phantom Gaming 4 with AMD Ryzen 5 3600X does not detect
  the card. We can see no corresponding entry in lspci.
* After associating the card to vfio-pci, lspci command can reboot the
  system even if firewire-ohci driver is not loaded. I can regenerate it
  in both Gigabyte AX370-Gaming 5/ASUS TUF Gaming X570-plus with AMD
  Ryzen 2400G.

I'm plreased to see if you have extra ideas to get helpful output from
the system. But I guess that I should start finding some workaround to
avoid the issued access to register instead of investigating the reboot
mechanism, sigh...

Anyway, thanks for your help.

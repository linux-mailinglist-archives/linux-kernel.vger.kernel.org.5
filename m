Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker. What's the
status here? The regression that was supposed to be fixed by the patched
that started this thread was reported 9 weeks ago[1] and the culprit
made it to many stable kernels as well. Would be really good to finally
fix this, as a regression like this should ideally be fixed within 2 to
3 weeks (in both mainline and stable). With a revert if necessary -- is
this maybe still a option, or would that cause more trouble then it
solved (I guess that's the case).

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

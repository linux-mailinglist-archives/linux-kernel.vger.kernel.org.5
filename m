I saw some mention about BIOS knobs that controlled the minimum
acceptable SATA link speed or something; that's the kind of thing I
wondered about.

Haha, yeah, I know!  I noticed in your response to Sathya that you're
running a 4.19.288 kernel, which is really, really old.  If it's
practical, the first thing I would try is booting a current kernel,
e.g., v6.4, on the chance that something has been fixed since v4.19.
I didn't try to compare the mptsas driver to see if it has changed
since then, so I don't know whether it's likely.

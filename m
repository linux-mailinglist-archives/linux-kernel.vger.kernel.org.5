Yeah, it's my preferred method as well, but it's not going to be

So I think no matter what we want the DOE protocols exposed via sysfs.
That will allow tools like lspci to report the DOE protocols
supported.

Any other features aren't going to use sysfs. The future question of a
DOE mailbox or exposing SPDM bits does seem to be already determined
anyway.

Agreed

I do think that listing the protocols in sysfs makes sense, even with
a mailbox somewhere else makes sense. In saying that I don't think we
will end up adding mailbox support anyway.

That seems like the best approach to me as well.

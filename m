No. However, (unrelated) in linux-next, rcu tests sometimes result in apparent hangs
or long runtime.

(hangs until aborted). This is primarily with Opteron CPUs, but also with others such as Haswell,
Icelake-Server, and pentium3. It is all but impossible to bisect because it doesn't happen
all the time. All I was able to figure out was that it has to do with rcu changes in linux-next.
I'd be much more concerned about that.

Understood. I'm basically just asking why this is the convention.

Because I assume that there must be a good reason for that. If there is none,
and it's really just because everyone is doing it, I personally think that's
not an objective rationale.

If there is no other reason it could even be just the opposite causality, as in
it became the convention because clippy enforces it. (Disclaimer: I really don't
know and so far I have no reason to assume so.)

Generally, I don't think there is anything wrong with questioning things and I
also don't think there is anything wrong in not accepting "because everyone does
so" as an objective rationale.

Otherwise I don't see any disagreement. I also understood that you want to be
consistent and comply with this convention and surely I accept that.

But again, I also think it's perfectly valid questioning things.

I'm honestly sorry about this misunderstanding and that this seems to be an
emotional discussion for you.

I never said that you don't have objective reasons (in general). I just said that
I don't consider *one specific rationale* as objective (or factual).

And I think it's perfectly valid to claim the right to do so. This isn't a personal
attack in any way.

It looks like the overhead of mem_cgroup_flush_stats() may be the cause 
of the performance regression. So what version of the Linux kernel are 
you using? From the patch listed in the URL above, it doesn't seem like 
you are using the latest kernel.

The latest upstream kernel already have patches that reduce rstat 
flushing overhead like commit 11192d9c124 ("memcg: flush stats only if 
updated"). Have you try to reproduce it with the latest kernel?

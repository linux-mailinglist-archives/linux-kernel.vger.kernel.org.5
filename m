Hello Niklas,

thank you for your report. This is some great analysis!

I am aware that this can happen. It's in fact why the index returned by
swiotlb_search_pool_area() is checked in swiotlb_find_slots().

This needs fixing.

Ah... Yes, the transient pool size must also be a multiple of segment
size, but it is not enforced.

This reminds me of my debugging session that resulted in commit
aabd12609f91 ("swiotlb: always set the number of areas before
allocating the pool") and this conversation:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/20230629074403.7f8ed9d6@meshulam.tesarici.cz/

Yes, this can happen.

I don't think it's possible to improve the allocation logic without
modifying the page allocator and/or the DMA atomic pool allocator to
take additional constraints into account.

I had a wild idea back in March, but it would require some intrusive
changes in the mm subsystem. Among other things, it would make memory
zones obsolete. I mean, people may actually like to get rid of DMA,
DMA32 and NORMAL, but you see how many nasty bugs were introduced even
by a relatively small change in SWIOTLB. Replacing memory zones with a
system based on generic physical allocation constraints would probably
blow up the universe. ;-)

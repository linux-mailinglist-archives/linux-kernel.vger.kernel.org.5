I think I lack some context here, but as Greg said Greybus
is intended to be a pure transport, and anything using it
should be able to get all information it needs as a layered
protocol on top of it.

If the BeaglePlay stuff requires CPort information, it sounds
like it's not managing the layering of abstractions properly.

It sounds like CC1352 is serving in an SVC role... sort of?  Again, I 
don't have enough context right now to understand.

Greybus was developed for a particular hardware platform, and it
included an SVC.  The SVC was an independent processor that managed
the "endo", or the basic hardware "backplane" that held modules).
The AP bridge was how the AP connected to that, and the GP bridge
was how a given module interface connected to that.

It seems to me (this is partly from an impression I had a few years
ago) that the BeaglePlay model doesn't align perfectly with that.
And if that's the case, we need to figure out how to resolve any
mismatches.

(I'm not sure this is very helpful, but it's a little background.)

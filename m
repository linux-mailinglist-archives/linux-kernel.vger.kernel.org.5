The warning is:
num-lanes: expected value is 1
which it has determined due to the presence of "ti,j721e-pcie-ep" in the first
check which is only applicable to AM64. The shared fallback compatible here is
responsible for incorrect checks when using "contains".

Using "contains", the check for "num-lanes" with "const: 1" corresponding to
AM64 ends up validating against the device-tree node for J7200 since the
fallback compatible "ti,j721e-pcie-ep" is "contained" in the list of compatibles
present in the device-tree node. That shouldn't be the case which is why "items"
is used in this patch to get an exact match.

This binding is different because of the existence of a shared fallback
compatible and a shared property being evaluated. In other bindings which use
contains, either there isn't a shared fallback compatible, or the property which
is present in device-tree nodes which have the shared fallback compatible isn't
evaluated.

In brief, with the existing device-tree, without any changes, adding "contains"
will throw warnings due to the incorrect schema matching for validating the
"num-lanes" property.

Either a "contains" or an "items" is required to evaluate the "num-lanes"
property and neither of them are present in the existing code.

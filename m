Well the device may be part of a topology, say Thunderbolt/USB4 (but can
be NVMe or similar) where it initially goes into D3hot but in the end
the whole topology is put into D3cold. The device driver really should
expect that this happens always and not try to distinguish between the
D3hot or D3cold.

Yes, this makes sense.

Just some thoughts...

Ok, so we attest the lower/upper file. What about the path the 
application specified to access that file (just an example)? Not that it 
particularly matters (we are not protecting it yet), but we are not 
recording in the IMA measurement list what the application 
requested/sees. I don't have a good example for inode metadata, but we 
already started recording them too.

Also, I'm thinking about overlayfs-own xattrs. Shouldn't they be 
protected? If they change during an offline attack, it would change how 
information are presented by overlayfs (I don't know much, for now).

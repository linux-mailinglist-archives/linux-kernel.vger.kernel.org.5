I don't really see how that aligns with what you've implemented, though. 
The coherent allocator doesn't have any notion of the caller's use-case, 
it's just going to allocate from wherever it happens to find space 
first. Thus even the calls which would somehow benefit from allocating 
from the "primary" region will have no way to guarantee that they will 
actually allocate from there if it's already been consumed by callers 
who didn't need that benefit but just happened to get there first.

Really that sounds like a case for having specific named memory-regions 
and managing them directly from the relevant driver, rather than trying 
to convince the generic dma-coherent abstraction to do things that don't 
really fit it. Otherwise I'd be slightly concerned that you're expecting 
to bake secret undocumented ABI into DMA API implementations where some 
particular order of allocations must guarantee a particular 
deterministic behaviour, which is really not something we want.

Thanks,
Robin.

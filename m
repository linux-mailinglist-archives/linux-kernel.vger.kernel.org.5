Yes, but you are trading off the complexity of adding
yet-another-protocol-parser to the kernel vs. making a strict
user/kernel api, right?

Which one is correct?  Can you verify that this parser really is correct
and doesn't have any overflows/security issues in it?  I can't, maybe
someone needs to write it in rust :)

The DW PCIe IP-core version is 4.90a.

Yes, it's the same even in the DW PCIe IP-core version 4.90a Databook:

3.5.7.2 RC Mode

Two BARs are present but are not expected to be used. You should disable them or
else they will be unnecessarily assigned memory during device enumeration. If
you do use a BAR, then you should program it to capture TLPs that are targeted
to your local non-application memory space residing on TRGT1, and not for the
application on TRGT1. The BAR range must be outside of the three Base/Limit regions.

I will check that. Thank you for sharing your feedback.

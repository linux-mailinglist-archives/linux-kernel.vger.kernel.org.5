Yes, add_new_gdb_meta_bg is only called with first group of mebg and no real
bug here.

Ah, what I want to say is "support non-frist group in fulture". And if there
is definely no need in fulture, it's more intuitive just treat group from caller
as first group in meta_bg.

When all reserved primary blocks are consumed, we create meta_bg group and
allocate new primary block at first block or block after backup superblock
(if exsiting) in first group of meta_bg group.
This function is only called when first group of meta_bg is added.

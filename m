I think I see what you mean now. Maybe I wrongly assumed the above 'Skip
reprogram of event' code could early return and skip over
"tick_program_event(KTIME_MAX, 1);", but I think it cannot because of the
"expires != ts->next_tick" check.

 Maybe the "tick_program_event(KTIME_MAX, 1)" bit in tick_nohz_handler() is
 supposed to handle buggy hardware where an unexpected timer event came
 through? In such a situation, the idle loop will not write
 "tick_program_event(KTIME_MAX, 1);" again because it already did so the
 previous time, as you pointed.

Adding Vineeth who is also looking into this code.

thanks,

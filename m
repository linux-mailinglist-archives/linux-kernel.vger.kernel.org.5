I tried this on a machine with 72 cpus (also ixion), running both
netserver and netperf in /sys/fs/cgroup/a/b/c/d as follows:
# echo "+memory" > /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.subtree_control
# mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/a
# echo "+memory" > /sys/fs/cgroup/a/cgroup.subtree_control
# mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/a/b
# echo "+memory" > /sys/fs/cgroup/a/b/cgroup.subtree_control
# mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/a/b/c
# echo "+memory" > /sys/fs/cgroup/a/b/c/cgroup.subtree_control
# mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/a/b/c/d
# echo 0 > /sys/fs/cgroup/a/b/c/d/cgroup.procs
# ./netserver -6

# echo 0 > /sys/fs/cgroup/a/b/c/d/cgroup.procs
# for i in $(seq 10); do ./netperf -6 -H ::1 -l 60 -t TCP_SENDFILE --
-m 10K; done

That's ~2% regression. Did I do anything incorrectly?

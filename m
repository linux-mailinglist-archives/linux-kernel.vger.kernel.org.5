Just a thought here, instead of deprecating it I was thinking if possible
to keep the power-domains and performance-domains separate and just extend
the genpd to handle the latter. There by we are not mixing up and creating
confusions that need more specific definitions in the binding(which is not
a big deal) but platforms getting it wrong inspite of that is a big problem.
Keep it separate makes it more aligned to the hardware and doesn't dilute
the definitions and probably avoids any possible mistakes due to that.

Sorry Ulf I am just not yet convinced to mix them up yet ðŸ˜‰ and wish you
don't convince me to. Let me know why the above suggestion won't work.

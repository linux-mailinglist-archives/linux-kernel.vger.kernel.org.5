Indeed, we do not support compile-time fixed VA_BITS! We could, but that 
would only be used for custom kernels. I don't think distro kernels will 
ever (?) propose 3 different kernels for sv39, sv48 and sv57 because the 
cost of dynamically choosing the address space width is not big enough 
to me (and the burden of maintaining 3 different kernels is).

Let me know if I'm wrong, I'd be happy to work on that.

Thanks,

Alex

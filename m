We're talking about DP/eDP specifically here, but yeah, you got it! :-)

Cool, I'm happy that we think alike. That's also my point...

Chen-Yu, Alexandre had/have questions about if there was any other solution instead
of using the solution of *this* commit, so, if there's any other better solution
than the one that I've sent as this commit.

I'm the one saying that this commit is the best solution :-P

Cheers,
Angelo

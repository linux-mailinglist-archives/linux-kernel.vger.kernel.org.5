Currently when page_pool_create() is called with
PP_FLAG_PAGE_FRAG flag, page_pool_alloc_pages() is only
allowed to be called under the below constraints:
1. page_pool_fragment_page() need to be called to setup
   page->pp_frag_count immediately.
2. page_pool_defrag_page() often need to be called to drain
   the page->pp_frag_count when there is no more user will
   be holding on to that page.

Those constraints exist in order to support a page to be
split into multi fragments.

And those constraints have some overhead because of the
cache line dirtying/bouncing and atomic update.

Those constraints are unavoidable for case when we need a
page to be split into more than one fragment, but there is
also case that we want to avoid the above constraints and
their overhead when a page can't be split as it can only
hold a fragment as requested by user, depending on different
use cases:
use case 1: allocate page without page splitting.
use case 2: allocate page with page splitting.
use case 3: allocate page with or without page splitting
            depending on the fragment size.

Currently page pool only provide page_pool_alloc_pages() and
page_pool_alloc_frag() API to enable the 1 & 2 separately,
so we can not use a combination of 1 & 2 to enable 3, it is
not possible yet because of the per page_pool flag
PP_FLAG_PAGE_FRAG.

So in order to allow allocating unsplit page without the
overhead of split page while still allow allocating split
page we need to remove the per page_pool flag in
page_pool_is_last_frag(), as best as I can think of, it seems
there are two methods as below:
1. Add per page flag/bit to indicate a page is split or
   not, which means we might need to update that flag/bit
   everytime the page is recycled, dirtying the cache line
   of 'struct page' for use case 1.
2. Unify the page->pp_frag_count handling for both split and
   unsplit page by assuming all pages in the page pool is split
   into a big fragment initially.

As page pool already supports use case 1 without dirtying the
cache line of 'struct page' whenever a page is recyclable, we
need to support the above use case 3 with minimal overhead,
especially not adding any noticeable overhead for use case 1,
and we are already doing an optimization by not updating
pp_frag_count in page_pool_defrag_page() for the last fragment
user, this patch chooses to unify the pp_frag_count handling
to support the above use case 3.

There is no noticeable performance degradation and some
justification for unifying the frag_count handling with this
patch applied using a micro-benchmark testing in [1].

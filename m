That flag is set for enclaves, do you mean we set similar flag in vepc  
struct?

One LRU should be OK as we only need relative order in which they are  
loaded?
If an VA page is in front of vEPC, we just kill host side enclave first  
before disrupting VMs in the same group.
As the group is not in a good situation anyway so kernel just pick  
something reasonable to force kill.

Also after rereading the sentences "The virtual EPC code didn't actually  
kill the VM process, it instead just freed all of the  EPC pages and  
abused the SGX architecture to effectively make the guest  recreate all  
its enclaves..."

Maybe by "kill" vm, Sean means EREMOVE the vepc pages in the unreclaimable  
LRU, which effectively make enclaves in guest receiving "EPC lost" error  
and those enclaves are forced to be reloaded (all reasonable user space  
impl should already handle that). Not sure about free *all* of EPC pages  
though. we should just EREMOVE enough to bring down the usage. And disable  
new allocation in sgx_vepc_fault as kai outlined above. It also means user  
space needs to inject/pass the SIGBUS to guest (I'm not really familiar  
with this part, or maybe it's already there?). @sean is that what you  
mean? Sorry I've been slow on understanding this.

If this is the case, some may still think it's too disruptive to guest  
because the guest did not have a chance to paging out less active enclave  
pages. But it's user's limit to set so it is justifiable as long as we  
document this behavior.

Thanks to both of you for great insights.

Haitao

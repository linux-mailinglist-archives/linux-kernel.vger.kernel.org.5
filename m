My testcase is in a memory cgroup with memory limit of 10MB, the memory can
be freed is only about 5MB.

Yes.

The swapcache pages and non-swapcache pages are both in anon lru. So when scan
anon pages, then non-swapcache pages will also be scanned. In isolate_lru_folios(),
if we select to put non-swapcache pages in folios_skipped list, the scan of anon list
will running until finding enough swapcache pages, this will waste too much time.
To avoid such problem, after we scan enough anon pages, even if we don't isolate
enough swapcache pages, we have to stop.

I mean scan of anon pages, include both swapcache pages and non-swpacache pages.

Thanks for your advice. If finally decide to use this patch, I will revise it.

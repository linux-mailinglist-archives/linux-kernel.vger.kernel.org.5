IIUC, _HID ACPI0016 indicates a CXL host bridge.  ACPI r6.5, sec
6.5.11, says "The _UID object is required in order to allow OSPM to
match entries in the CEDT to devices present in the ACPI namespace."

I don't see anything about a requirement to map an ACPI0016 devices to
a PCI device.  At least in the non-CXL world, there *is* no way to map
a PNP0A08 device to a PCI device because a host bridge is not a PCI
devices itself (it has an unspecified non-PCI primary interface and a
PCI secondary interface).

So from the patch and the ACPI/CXL specs, it looks like the problem
doesn't involve PCI at all; it just looks like an ACPI0016 object is
required to contain a _UID, and on this buggy BIOS it doesn't.

My question was just prompted by the "ACPI => PCI mapping" in the
commit log.  Since PCI doesn't seem involved, maybe just drop that
reference?

It's just a buggy BIOS that doesn't supply _UID for an ACPI0016
object, so you can't locate the corresponding CEDT entry, right?

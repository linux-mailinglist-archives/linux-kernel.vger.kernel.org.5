Hi Ted, thanks for the explain. Here are more updates from what I found:
I find that descriptor_loc show layout of gdb blocks in s_group_desc[]
which is: block of s_group_desc[i] will be superblock + i + 1 for
non-meta_bg and 'first block of meta_bg' + has_super for meta_bg.
Although descriptor_loc is called to initialize s_group_desc[], the
expanded gdb block to s_group_desc from add_new_gdb obeys the same
layout.
Back to the original purpose of this patch which is to remove
unnecessary of equality check of s_group_desc[gdb_num - 1].b_blocknr and
s_group_desc[gdb_num].b_blocknr, we can see each s_group_desc has it's
own block from layout above and the check should be unnecessary.
But no insistant on this if you still have concern about it.

I plan to add comment in fs/ext4.h as following:
struct ext4_sb_info {
	...
	struct buffer_head * __rcu *s_group_desc; /* Primary gdb blocks of online groups */
But I'm not sure it's proper now as you menthioned s_group_desc[] is to
keep the buffer_heads for the block group descriptor blocks in memory
and it contains primary gdb block is a coincidence that we only modify
primary block in kernel.

Besides, I plan to go through the resize code again in fulture and
add some comments to make it easy for anyone starting read this
or make it easy to maintain. Please let me if you disklike it.

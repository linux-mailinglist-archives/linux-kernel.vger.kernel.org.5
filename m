In this particular case, I tried making sense of what was the _UID
value, and what was actually in the CEDT.  There was no sense to be
made.

For this device, it was ACPI0016:02 with a _UID of CX02.  For this
particular vendor BIOS, all ACPI0016:* devices' _UID's counted up from
CX01 => CX* sequentially.  But what was actually in the CEDT in this
particular case for ACPI0016:02 was 49.  I attempted hex, octal, atoi(),
literal string interpretation per-character, etc.  It was just plain
wrong.

Pasting an acpidump is difficult...  It'll be tricky since this particular
host is walled off from the world.  And moving data in and out of this
environment is quite challenging due to regulatory reasons.

acpi_evaluate_integer() in this case was returning AE_BUFFER_OVERFLOW.

In the meantime, I'm fine either fixing up the commit message per
Jonathan's review, or I'm fine shelving it in favor of a broader effort
to fix the underlying BIOS's with the vendors.  I don't have a strong
preference.  I've been in the weeds with this for awhile, so I know why
it's breaking.  But someone new to CXL with shiny new hardware may be
left scratching their heads.

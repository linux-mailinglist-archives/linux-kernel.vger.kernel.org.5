Ah, I guess here is the thing I missed that make this confusing:
sbi->s_group_desc contains only primary block of each group. i.e.
sbi->s_group_desc['i'] is the primary gdb block of group 'i'. It's clear
that primary gdb blocks of different groups will not be the same. Then
all blocks in s_group_desc[*] should be different and the removed check
is unnecessary.
From add_new_gdb and add_new_gdb_meta_bg, we can find that we always
add primary gdb block of new group to s_group_desc. To be more specific:
add_new_gdb
	gdblock = EXT4_SB(sb)->s_sbh->b_blocknr + 1 + gdb_num;
	gdb_bh = ext4_sb_bread(sb, gdblock, 0);
	n_group_desc[gdb_num] = gdb_bh;

add_new_gdb_meta_bg
	gdblock = ext4_meta_bg_first_block_no(sb, group) +
		  ext4_bg_has_super(sb, group);
	gdb_bh = ext4_sb_bread(sb, gdblock, 0);
	n_group_desc[gdb_num] = gdb_bh;

Yes, I agree with this. I wonder if a series to add comments of some
common rules is good to you. Like the information mentioned above
that s_group_desc contains primary gdb block of each group.

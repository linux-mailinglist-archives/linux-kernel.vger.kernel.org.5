What testing have you done to make sure that this is OK?  "May have
had enough time"?  That's not very reassuring?

Also, note that we can't actually reuse the bit position of
CAP_SYS_ADMIN since it's likely that there may be pre-existing
capability masks that are still using that position.  So there isn't
all that much upside in trying to retire CAP_SYS_ADMIN --- if you as a
system administrator think it's not too course, then just don't use
it.

It's unclear to me what goal you have in trying to mess with the
capability definitions?  Perhaps it might be useful if you were to
explicitly state your goals in these proposals?

Thanks,

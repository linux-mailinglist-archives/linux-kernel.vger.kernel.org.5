When the emulators and vCPUs have affinity on same CPUs, the VM
performance is worse than when emulators and vCPUs have affinity on
different CPUs. Emulators will steal time from vCPU, since we need them
to deal with some IO/net requests. If we allocate 4 pCPUs to one VM, we
do not want it's emulators to run on other pCPU, which may interfere
with other VMs. May be SPDK/DPDK will alleviate the issue.

Agreed, I added a KVM parameter to do that, and default trapping vCPU WFI.

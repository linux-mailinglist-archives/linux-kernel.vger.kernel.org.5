I've implemented the batching as David suggested, and I'm pretty confident it's
correct. The only problem is that during testing I can't provoke the code to
take the path. I've been pouring through the code but struggling to figure out
under what situation you would expect the swap entry passed to
free_swap_and_cache() to still have a cached folio? Does anyone have any idea?

This is the original (unbatched) function, after my change, which caused David's
concern that we would end up calling __try_to_reclaim_swap() far too much:

int free_swap_and_cache(swp_entry_t entry)
{
	struct swap_info_struct *p;
	unsigned char count;

	if (non_swap_entry(entry))
		return 1;

	p = _swap_info_get(entry);
	if (p) {
		count = __swap_entry_free(p, entry);
		if (count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE)
			__try_to_reclaim_swap(p, swp_offset(entry),
					      TTRS_UNMAPPED | TTRS_FULL);
	}
	return p != NULL;
}

The trouble is, whenever its called, count is always 0, so
__try_to_reclaim_swap() never gets called.

My test case is allocating 1G anon memory, then doing madvise(MADV_PAGEOUT) over
it. Then doing either a munmap() or madvise(MADV_FREE), both of which cause this
function to be called for every PTE, but count is always 0 after
__swap_entry_free() so __try_to_reclaim_swap() is never called. I've tried for
order-0 as well as PTE- and PMD-mapped 2M THP.

I'm guessing the swapcache was already reclaimed as part of MADV_PAGEOUT? I'm
using a block ram device as my backing store - I think this does synchronous IO
so perhaps if I have a real block device with async IO I might have more luck?
Just a guess...

Or perhaps this code path is a corner case? In which case, perhaps its not worth
adding the batching optimization after all?

Thanks,
Ryan

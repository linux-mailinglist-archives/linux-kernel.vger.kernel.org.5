Thanks for the context.

The problem is that you cannot fully monitor or control all the
resources charged to a control domain. The example of common shared
libraries stands, the pages are charged on first touch basis. You
can't easily control it or monitor who is charged for what exactly.
Even if you can find out, is the answer to leave the cgroup alive
forever because it is charged for a shared resource?

Thanks for the context, and sorry if my framing was inaccurate. I was
more focused on the in-kernel semantics rather than user-visible
semantics. Nonetheless, with today's status or with reparenting, once
the memory is at the root level (whether reparented to the root level,
or in a zombie memcg whose parent is root), the memory has effectively
escaped accounting. This is not a new problem that reparenting would
introduce, but it's a problem that recharging is trying to fix that
reparenting won't.

As I outlined above, the semantics of recharging are not new, they are
equivalent to reclaiming and refaulting the memory in a more
accelerated/efficient manner. The indeterminism in recharging is very
similar to reclaiming and refaulting.

What do you think?

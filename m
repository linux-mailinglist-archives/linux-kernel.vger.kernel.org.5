I don't know what you mean there, so I think you may have the wrong end of the
stick.

All the ARM PMU drivers handle revelant PERF_EVENT_TYPE_HARDWARE events
directly; they check perf_event_attr::type, and interpret
perf_event_attr::config dependent upon this. 

For example, the Apple M1 PMU driver has a table mapping
PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES and PERF_COUNT_HW_INSTRUCTIONS to its native events:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/perf/apple_m1_cpu_pmu.c?h=v6.7#n134

.. which is used by the m1_pmu_map_event() and m2_pmu_map_event() callbacks:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/perf/apple_m1_cpu_pmu.c?h=v6.7#n485

.. which is used by __hw_perf_event_init() when called by armpmu_event_init,
which is used as the pmu::event_init() callback:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/perf/arm_pmu.c?h=v6.7#n443
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/perf/arm_pmu.c?h=v6.7#n500

The sysfs events were added so that PMU-specific events (in the namespace of
the PMU's dynamic type id) could be advertised to userspace. Those weren't
added in lieu of the PERF_EVENT_TYPE_HARDWARE events.

When support for big.LITTLE was added (years prior to the introduction of the
extended HW type support), it was necessary to use those sysfs events to target
events to specific PMUs (since those used the PMU's dynamic type id, and would
only be handled by that specific PMU). Hence why Marc and Hector were using
those events on their systems.

AFAICT there's nothing missing from the drivers w.r.t. event mapping.

The problem Hector and Marc encountered was the result of a number of
interacting parts:

1) The logic in the perf tool to detect support for extended type support was
   not robust to PMUs requiring event filters and failed to detect support for
   the extended type for the Apple PMUs which require the exclude_guest filter.

2) The interpretation of 'pmu/event/' was changed to try to interpret 'event'
   as a PERF_EVENT_TYPE_HARDWARE event. For the Apple PMU, this changed the
   interpretation of 'apple_pmu_name/cycles/' and
   'apple_pmu_name/instructions/'.

3) Even in the absence of (detected) support for extended type support, the
   perf tool interpreted 'apple_pmu_name/cycles/' and
   'apple_pmu_name/instructions/' as PERF_EVENT_TYPE_HARDWARE events, but since
   it thought that the kernel didn't support the extended HW type, it didn't
   set the extended bits to target specific PMUs. Hence the kernel didn't know
   which PMUs to route the events to specifically, and those were handled by an
   arbitrary PMU which could handle PERF_EVENT_TYPE_HARDWARE events.

.. hence the issue that Hector and Marc reported with events going to a
different PMU from what they explicitly requested.

As I've said before, I think that (2) is a problem in its own right, since even
with (1) fixed, clashing event names could have different semantics, and it
would be better to have a distinct syntax for "PERF_EVENT_TYPE_HARDWARE event
on this specific PMU" vs "native event on this PMU".

I was only asking for an opinion on the analysis/suggestion, no testing
necessary.

I've spun up the diff below, which works in local testing. I'll go write up a
commit message and send it out as a proper patch shortly.

Mark.

In fact, there still might be a remaining bug, because even with this 
patch it is possible for usb_hub_to_struct_hub() to return NULL.  You 
can test for this possibility by editing the disable_show() routine: 
Move the initializations of the local variables out of the declaration 
lines and into the main part of the routine, and add a delay (like 
msleep(1000)) before the call to usb_hub_to_struct_hub() -- this will 
make the bug a lot easier to trigger (you could even do it by hand).

I think to fully fix this problem it will be necessary to test whether 
hub is NULL before using it.  The same problem ought to exist in 
disable_show(), even though your testing didn't trigger it.

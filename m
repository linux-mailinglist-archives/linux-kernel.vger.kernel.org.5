I have to admit I am rather confused by cgroup_rstat_flush (and
cgroup_rstat_flush_locked). The former says it can block but the later
doesn't ever block and even if it drops the cgroup_rstat_lock it merely
cond_rescheds or busy loops. How much of a contention and yielding can
you see with this patch? What is the worst case? How bad a random user
can make the situation by going crazy and trying to flush from many
different contexts?

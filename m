So, I'm not really sure how to approach this.  It seems 'unwise'/'unworkable' to
instantiate the device tree blob for the interrupt controller we already have
ACPI for and without that I have nothing to route to.

Or can we just ignore the interrupt map stuff completely and instead
rely on instantiating an interrupt controller on the card (that under
the hood uses non DT paths to make interrupts actually happen?)

That path to me seems workable and keeps the boundary of ACPI vs DT
actually getting used within the card specific driver.

Suggestions welcome!

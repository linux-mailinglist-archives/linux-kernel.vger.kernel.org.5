Overloading EROFS_FEATURE_SB_CSUM in combination with
COMPAT_XATTR_FILTER would break all existing deployments of libblkid, so
it's not an option.

All other serious and halfway modern filesystems do have superblock
checksums which are also checked by libblkid.

From libblkid side nothing really speaks against a simpler checksum.
XOR is easy to implement and xxhash is already part of libblkid for
other filesystems.

The drawbacks are:
* It would need a completely new feature bit in erofs.
* Old versions of libblkid could not validate checksums on newer
  filesystems.

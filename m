Yeah, from what you write it seems that the replay code is using buffered
reads on the journal file. I guess you could confirm that with a bit of
kernel tracing but the symptoms look pretty convincing. Did you try talking
to MYSQL guys about why they are doing this?

Yes, XFS has inherited stronger consistency guarantees from IRIX times than
Linux filesystems traditionally had. We generally don't even guarantee
buffered read vs buffered write atomicity (i.e., buffered read can see a
torn buffered write).

Hi Abhijeet,

It's been a while when we discussed an EM feature presented on some
Android common kernel Gerrit (Nov 2021).

You've been interested in this feature back then.

I have a gentle ask, if you are still interested in. It would be nice if
you (or some other Qcom engineer) could leave a feedback comment
(similar what you have made for the Gerrit original series). I will be
really grateful.

In this cover letter, there are some power saving numbers from
a real phone, with also performance metrics (janky frames). You might
be interested in those scenarios as well.

Regards,
Lukasz

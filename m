I think the problem is in the "waiting in interrupt context".

Can you change qi_submit_sync() to *sleep* until the queue is done?
Instead of busy-waiting in atomic context?

Is the hardware capable of sending an interrupt once the queue is done?
If it is not capable, would it be viable to poll with exponential backoff
and sleep in-between polling once the polling delay increases beyond, say,
10 usec?

Again, the proposed patch is not a proper solution.  It will paper over
the issue most of the time but every once in a while someone will still
get a hard lockup splat and it will then be more difficult to reproduce
and fix if the proposed patch is accepted.

I don't see any reason to hide the kernel version.
This isn't Intel Confidential information.

__dmar_remove_one_dev_info() was removed by db75c9573b08 in v6.0
one and a half years ago, so the stack trace appears to be from
an older kernel version.

Thanks,

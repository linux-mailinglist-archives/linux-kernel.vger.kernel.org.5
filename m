Thanks for checking Ted.

We don't have fast_commit feature enabled. So it should correspond to 
this line:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/fs/jbd2/commit.c?h=linux-5.10.y#n496

I see all other stacks apart from kjournald have "start_this_handle".

To me it looks like its waiting on some process to close the transaction 
handle.
One point to note here is we pretty run low on memory in this usecase. 
The download starts
eating memory really fast.

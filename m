In this case, total size of shared memory usually is small(< 100MB).
What's more, almost shared pages were file cache. So it doesn't present any problems.

Wow! per-memcg interface is also what we need.
It's hardly to control user's behaviors in our envrionment. We can't promise that all
process who share memory would be in same memcg.
Maybe kernel should provide new interface to make shared page charge more predictable.
I think it would take some overhead to do this.

The key problem of us is that we can't check whether page is accesed(no gen or ref changed) 
in this case.
page belongs to A, but maybe process in B read/write this page more frequently.
we may treat this page as cold page but accutly hot page.
Maybe just call folio_mark_accessed instead of folio_update_gen(should hold memcg lru lock)
for those remote memcg pages?

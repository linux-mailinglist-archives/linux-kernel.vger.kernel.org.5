We have boards with 2 I2C busses with an SC16IS752IBS on both. The UARTs
are configured in infrared mode, and they send receive IR signals
constantly. I guess the same would happen with other electrical
interfaces, but the important bit is that the UARTs see a steady stream
of inbound data.

The bug has hit us on production units and when it does, sc16is7xx_irq()
would spin forever because sc16is7xx_port_irq() keeps seeing an
interrupt in the IIR register that is not cleared because the driver
does not call into sc16is7xx_handle_rx() unless the RXLVL register
reports at least one byte in the FIFO.

Note that this issue might only occur in revision E of the silicon. And
there seems to be now way to read the revision code through I2C, so I
guess you won't be able to figure out easily whether your chip is affected.

Let me know if I can provide more information.


Thanks,
Daniel

Is folio_trylock() really that expensive given the code path is already locking
multiple spinlocks, and I don't think we would expect the folio lock to be very
contended?

I guess filemap_get_folio() could be a bit more expensive, but again, is this
really a deal-breaker?


I'm just trying to refamiliarize myself with this series, but I think I ended up
allocating a cluster per cpu per order. So one potential solution would be to
turn the flag into a size and store it in the cluster info. (In fact I think I
was doing that in an early version of this series - will have to look at why I
got rid of that). Then we could avoid needing to figure out nr_pages from the folio.

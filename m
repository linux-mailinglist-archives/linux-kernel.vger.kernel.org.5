OK, no problem. I agree what you said.

Yeah, the 'nomodeset' disables all native drivers,
this is a good point of it, but this is also the weak point of it.

Sometimes, when you are developing a drm driver for a new device.
You will see the pain. Its too often a programmer's modification
make the entire Linux kernel hang there. The problematic drm
driver kernel module already in the initrd. Then, the real
need to disable the ill-functional drm driver kernel module
only. While what you recommend to disable them all. There
are subtle difference.

Another limitation of the 'nomodeset' parameter is that
it is only available on recent upstream kernel. Low version
downstream kernel don't has this parameter supported yet.
So this create inconstant developing experience. I believe that
there always some people need do back-port and upstream work
for various reasons.

While (kindly, no offensive) debating, since we have the modprobe.blacklist
why we still need the 'nomodeset' parameter ?
why not try modprobe.blacklist="amdgpu,radeon,i915,ast,nouveau,gma500_gfx, ..."

:-/


But OK in overall, I will listen to your advice.

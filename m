Correct, experienced users can choose any supported event.
Right now it doesn't even use any MEM_ (data_src) fields but it
should be added later.  BTW I think it'd be better to have an option
to enable the data src sample collection without gathering data MMAPs.

Glad you like it.

Yep, that should be supported.  Ideally it would display samples
(or overhead) for each event in an event group.  And you can
force individual events to a group at report/annotate time.
But it doesn't work well with this for now.  Will fix.

Right, will do that in the next spin.

I need that ;-)

At least, interactive transition between perf report and
perf annotate is really useful for me.  You should try
that someday.

Note that perf report TUI works well with data types.

I'm sure I missed some cases, but I managed to make it work on
usual cases.  We can improve it by handling it more cases and
instructions but it'd be great if we have a better support from the
toolchains.

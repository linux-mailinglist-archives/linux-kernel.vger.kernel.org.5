Yes, though RCU is -just- -barely- too slow, as one more grace period
would have done it.

And there might need to be a call_rcu_hurry() in there somewhere,
now that you mention it.  Which would pretty much defeat any sort of
lazy-RCU-callback testing in rcutorture, but testing of laziness might
need to be separate anyway.

Looking forward to seeing what you come up with!

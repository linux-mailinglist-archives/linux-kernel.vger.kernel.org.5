Yes. I understand it would be confusing.

Okay. If that's the case, then I see no reason to add the Link Width 
cooling device now as it could do nothing besides reporting the current 
link width.

The only question that then remains is how to take this into account in 
the naming of the cooling devices, currently PCIe_Port_<pci_name()> is 
used but perhaps it would be better to change that to 
PCIe_Port_Link_Speed_... to allow PCI_Port_Link_Width_... to be added 
later beside it?

Ability to control Link Width seems to be part of PCIe 6.0 L0p. AFAICT, 
the reasons are to lower/control power consumption so it seems to be 
within scope.

As an example, did you know that LPDDR4 chips, according to the official
JEDEC documentation, require proper sequencing of the ramping-down of 
their
power rails when they're to be turned off as part of shutting the system
down?  The documentation also specifies that the expected lifetime 
becomes
reduced when the powering-off isn't properly performed, and there's even 
an
official number of such unsafe power-offs that the LPDDR4 chips are 
actually
expected to survive.

Thus, just yanking a power cord from a device that uses LPDDR4 may 
actually
make it die prematurely.  Such behavior is kind of exected when it comes 
to
flash-based storage, but DRAM?  Things are weird these days. :)

Maybe I misunderstood your comments, but I am not sure why
the user ABI needs to change? I agree that logging after extension is
the right approach. But, IMO, it should be owned by the back end
TSM vendor drivers. The user ABI should just pass the digest and
RTMR index.

TDX uses EFI_TCG2_EVENT_LOG_FORMAT_TCG_2 log format. I think SEV is the
same.

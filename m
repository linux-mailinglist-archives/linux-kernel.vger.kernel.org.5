I meant "ATS Invalidation Request" here is one term in PCIe spec, 'valid'
is used to describe the word 'target'.

This patch isn't intended to work as the same logic as patch [2/3], this
aims to break the blindly dead loop not to retry the timeout request after
ITE fault happened.

Here we check to see if the ITE fault was caused by device is not present.
The opposite logic, not predict the future, but find the cause of the fault
already happened, if pci_device_is_present() tells us the device isn't
there, it is reliable I think.

There is a dead loop here to blindly retry to timeout request if
ITE happened, we want to break that loop if the target device was
gone.

That logic works for simple safe /surprise removal as described in
patch[2/3], no race there that case at all.

We are not relying on pci_device_is_present() here in this patch to close
the race window between aggressive surprise removal and ATS invalidation
Request, we are doing post-fault handling here.

AFAIK, most of the dma controllers support both memcpy and separate tx/rx
channels except a few like dw-edma where memcpy is not supported.

But for just memcpy, clients can use any registered DMA controller in the
system. For slave channels, it is best to pass them in DT since the client may
not know how the channels are laid out in the DMA controller.

Right. There is no need to do iATU translation for DMA. I avoid that in MHI
driver.

For TEST yes, but for MHI, no. In MHI, I kind of mix both iATU and DMA to ripe
most of the performance (small vs big transactions). But for the TEST driver, it
is fair to not call pci_epc_map_addr() when DMA_SLAVE is supported.

I do feel that we need to maintain the similarity within the EPF drivers, but it
is OK to let the drivers diverge a little for optimization.

Regarding the DMA_MEMCPY code in TEST driver. We need to keep it for backwards
compatibility since not all platforms are passing the slave channels in
devicetree.

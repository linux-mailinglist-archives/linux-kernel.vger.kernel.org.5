Hi Bart, thanks for the references!

I don't know the details of the UFS devices bad performance problem.
But I feel it maybe caused by the too lazy queue idle handling, which
is now only handled in queue timeout work.

Another problem maybe the wakeup batch algorithm, which is too subtle.
And there were some IO hang problems caused by it in the past.

So yes, we should improve it, although I don't have good idea for now,
need to do some tests and analysis.

As for removing all this code, I don't know from my limited knowledge.
It was introduced to improve relative fair tags sharing between queues,
to avoid starvation. And the proposed alternative looks too complex to me.

Thanks.

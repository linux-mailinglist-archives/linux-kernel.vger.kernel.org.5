Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker. Partially
top-posting for once, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

Thx for the report. To quote one aspect:

> v6.4 has no leaks.

I pretty sure you mean stock 6.4 here. But FWIW, the culprit was
backported to 6.4.y and 6.1.y, so they latest versions might be affected
as well.

For the rest of this mail:

[TLDR: I'm adding this report to the list of tracked Linux kernel
regressions; the text you find below is based on a few templates
paragraphs you might have encountered already in similar form.
See link in footer if these mails annoy you.]

To be sure the issue doesn't fall through the cracks unnoticed, I'm
adding it to regzbot, the Linux kernel regression tracking bot:

#regzbot ^introduced e54223275ba1bc6f704a6bab015fcd2ae4f72572
#regzbot title PCI: comm "swapper/0" leaking memory
#regzbot ignore-activity

This isn't a regression? This issue or a fix for it are already
discussed somewhere else? It was fixed already? You want to clarify when
the regression started to happen? Or point out I got the title or
something else totally wrong? Then just reply and tell me -- ideally
while also telling regzbot about it, as explained by the page listed in
the footer of this mail.

Developers: When fixing the issue, remember to add 'Link:' tags pointing
to the report (the parent of this mail). See page linked in footer for
details.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

My recollection is that putting Root Ports into D3hot on older x86
systems would raise MCEs, which is why pci_bridge_d3_possible() only
allows D3hot in cases which are known to work (e.g. Thunderbolt
controllers, machines with a recent BIOS).  It was a conservative
policy chosen to avoid regressions.

I don't know if similar issues exist on non-ACPI systems.  If they
don't exist, platform_pci_bridge_d3() could just return true for
all devicetree-based systems.  Might be worth testing if any systems
can be found which exhibit issues with such a policy.  That would
obviate the need to specify "supports-d3" in the devicetree.
Quite the opposite, ports which are known not to work could be
blacklisted.  Of course if it turns out that's the majority then
whitelisting via "supports-d3" is a better option.

I think we're putting devices into D3hot first before cutting power
(i.e. putting them into D3cold), so knowing that D3hot is safe is
basically a prerequisite for D3cold.

Thanks,

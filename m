+Qualcomm Minidump Feature
+=========================
+
+Introduction
+------------
+
+Minidump is a best effort mechanism to collect useful and predefined
+data for post-mortem debugging on a Qualcomm System on chip(SoCs).
+
+Minidump is built on the premise that a hardware or software component
+on the SoC has encountered an unexpected fault. This means that data
+collected by Minidump can not be assumed to be correct or Minidump
+collection itself could fail.
+
+Qualcomm SoCs in engineering mode provides mechanism for generating
+complete RAM dump for both kernel/non-kernel crashes for postmortem
+debugging however, on a end user product taking complete RAM dump at
+the time of failure has substantial storage requirement as well as it
+is time consuming to transfer them electronically. To encounter this
+problem, Minidump was introduced in Qualcomm boot firmware that provides
+a way to collect selected region in the final RAM dump which is less
+in size compared to complete RAM dump.
+
+Qualcomm SoCs contains Application Processor SubSystem(APSS) and its
+co-processor like Audio Digital Signal Process(ADSP), Compute DSP(CDSP),
+MODEM running their operating system or firmware can register their
+selected region in their respective table called SubSystem table of
+content (SS-ToC) and the addresses of these tables is further maintained
+in a separate table called Global Table of Content (G-ToC) inside separate
+region maintaied inside RAM called Shared memory(SMEM). More about shared
+memory can be found inside ``driver/soc/qcom/smem.c`` under doc section
+and it is briefly discussed in later section.
+
+It is to note that SubSystems, Remote processors and co-processors have
+same meaning in this document and been used interchangeably.

+
+G-ToC: Global table of contents
+SSX-ToC: SubSystem X table of contents
+         X is an integer in the range of 0 to 10
+         Older boot firmware has kept this limit to 10
+         however, in newer firmware this number is expected to change
+
+SSX-MSn: SubSystem memory segments numbered from 0 to n
+         For APSS, n is limited to 200 from older boot firmware
+
+         Older boot firmware statically allocates 300 as total number of
+         supported region across all SubSystem in Minidump table out of
+         which, APSS limit is kept to 201. In future, this limitation
+	 from boot firmware might get removed by allocating the region
+	 dynamically. APSS Minidump kernel driver keeping this limit to
+	 201 to be compatible with older boot firmware.
+
+SMEM is a section of RAM reserved by boot firmware and is the backbone of
+Minidump functionality to work. It is also a medium of inter processor
+communication and a way where boot firmware can prepare something for
+upcoming operating system usage.
+
+Qualcomm SoCs boot firmware must reserve an area of RAM as SMEM prior to
+handling over control to the run-time operating system. It creates SMEM
+partition for Minidump with ``SBL_MINIDUMP_SMEM_ID`` and creates an array
+of pointers called Global table of content (G-ToC) at the start of this
+partition. Each index of this array is uniquely assigned to each SubSystem
+like for APSS it is 0 while for ADSP, CDSP, MODEM it is 5, 7 and 3 respectively.
+points to their table of segments called SS-ToC to be included in the Minidump.
+
+From the diagram above, Global Table of Contents (G-ToC) enumerates a fixed
+size number of SubSystem Table of Contents (SS-ToC) structures. Each
+SS-ToC contains a list of SubSystem Memory Segments which are named
+according to the containing SS-ToC hence, SSX-MSn where "X" denotes the
+SubSystem index of the containing SSX-ToC and "n" denotes an individual
+Memory segment within the SubSystem. Hence, SS0-MS0 belongs to SS0-ToC
+whereas SS1-MS0 belongs to SS1-ToC. Segment structure contains name,
+base address, size of a Segment to be dumped.
+
+The Application Processor SubSystem (APSS) runs the Linux kernel and is
+therefore not responsible for assembling Minidump data. One of the other
+system agents in the SoC will be responsible for capturing the Minidump
+data during system reset. Typically one of the SoC Digital Signal
+Processors (DSP) will be used for this purpose. During reset, the DSP will
+walk the G-ToC, SSX-ToCs and SSX-MSns either., dump the regions as binary
+blob into storage or pushed outside to the attached host machine via USB
+(more described in Dump collection section below).
+
+Qualcomm Remote Processor Minidump support
+------------------------------------------
+
+Linux Kernel support recovery and coredump collection on remote processor
+failure through remoteproc framework and in this document, remote processors
+meant for ADSP, CDSP, MODEM etc. Qualcomm remoteproc driver has support for
+collecting Minidump for remote processors as well where each remote processor
+has their unique statically assigned descriptor in the G-ToC which is
+represented via ``minidump_id`` in ``driver/remoteproc/qcom_q6v5_pas.c``
+and it helps getting further information about valid registered region from
+firmware and later collecting via remoteproc coredump framework.
+
+Qualcomm APSS Minidump kernel driver concept
+--------------------------------------------
+
+Qualcomm APSS Minidump kernel driver adds the capability to add Linux
+region to be dumped as part of Minidump collection. Shared memory
+driver creates platform device for Minidump driver and on Minidump
+driver probe it gets the G-ToC address (``struct minidump_global_toc``)
+by querying Minidump SMEM ID ``SBL_MINIDUMP_SMEM_ID`` as one of parameter
+to ``qcom_smem_get`` function. Further, driver uses APSS Minidump unique
+descriptor or index i.e., 0 to get APSS SubSystem ToC and fills up the
+fields of ``struct minidump_subsystem`` and allocates memory for Segment
+array of structure ``struct minidump_region`` of size compatible with
+boot firmware (default size is 201). This really means that total 201
+APSS regions can be registered for APSS alone and the Minidump kernel
+driver provides ``qcom_minidump_region_register`` and
+``qcom_minidump_region_unregister`` function to register and unregister
+APSS minidump region. Example usage explained in later section.
+
+To simplify post-mortem debugging, APSS driver registers the first region
+as an ELF header that gets updated each time a new region gets registered.
+and rest 200 region can be used by other APSS Minidump driver client.
+
+The solution supports extracting the Minidump produced either over USB
+or stored to an attached storage device, if not configured default mode
+is USB more described in Dump collection section.
+
+How a kernel client driver can register region with minidump
+------------------------------------------------------------
+
+A client driver can use ``qcom_minidump_region_register`` API's to register
+and ``qcom_minidump_region_unregister`` to unregister their region from
+minidump driver.
+
+A client needs to fill their region by filling ``qcom_minidump_region``
+structure object which consists of the region name, region's virtual
+and physical address and its size.
+
+ .. code-block:: c
+
+  #include <soc/qcom/qcom_minidump.h>
+  [...]
+
+
+  [... inside a function ...]
+  struct qcom_minidump_region region;
+
+  [...]
+
+  client_mem_region = kzalloc(region_size, GFP_KERNEL);
+  if (!client_mem_region)
+	return -ENOMEM;
+
+  [... Just write a pattern ...]
+  memset(client_mem_region, 0xAB, region_size);
+
+  [... Fill up the region object ...]
+  strlcpy(region.name, "REGION_A", sizeof(region.name));
+  region.virt_addr = client_mem_region;
+  region.phys_addr = virt_to_phys(client_mem_region);
+  region.size = region_size;
+
+  ret = qcom_minidump_region_register(&region);
+  if (ret < 0) {
+	pr_err("failed to add region in minidump: err: %d\n", ret);
+	return ret;
+  }
+
+  [...]
+
+
+Testing
+-------
+
+Existing Qualcomm SoCs already supports collecting complete RAM dump (also
+called full dump) can be configured by writing appropriate value to Qualcomm's
+top control and status register (tcsr) in ``driver/firmware/qcom_scm.c``.
+Complete RAM dump on system failure is where entire RAM snapshot is pushed out
+to Host computer attached to SoC via USB similar to one of the way will be
+used for Minidump described later in Dump collection section. Complete RAM
+dump entirely get controlled from Qualcomm boot firmware and is not related
+to Minidump or SMEM except the fact that same register is used to configure
+one of the mode.
+
+SCM device Tree bindings required to support download mode
+For example (sm8450) ::
+
+	/ {
+
+	[...]
+
+		firmware {
+			scm: scm {
+				compatible = "qcom,scm-sm8450", "qcom,scm";
+				[... tcsr register ... ]
+				qcom,dload-mode = <&tcsr 0x13000>;
+
+				[...]
+			};
+		};
+
+	[...]
+
+		soc: soc@0 {
+
+			[...]
+
+			tcsr: syscon@1fc0000 {
+				compatible = "qcom,sm8450-tcsr", "syscon";
+				reg = <0x0 0x1fc0000 0x0 0x30000>;
+			};
+
+			[...]
+		};
+	[...]
+
+	};
+
+A kernel command line parameter is provided to facilitate selection of
+dump mode also called download mode. Boot firmware configures download
+mode to be full dump even before Linux boots up however, one need to pass
+``qcom_scm.download_mode="mini"`` to switch the default download mode
+to Minidump. Similarly ``"full"`` need to be passed to set the download
+mode to full dump and passing ``"full,mini"`` will set the download mode
+where both Minidump along with fulldump will be collected on system failure
+however, this mode will only work if dump need to collected via USB more
+about this described in Dump collection section.
+
+Writing to sysfs node can also be used to set the mode to minidump::
+
+	echo "mini" > /sys/module/qcom_scm/parameter/download_mode
+
+Once the download mode is set, any kind of crash will make the device collect
+respective dump as per the set download mode.
+

+	|+++++++++++|<------------+
+	|+++++++++++|    usb cable
+	+-----------+
+            x86_64 PC
+
+The solution supports a product running with Qualcomm SoC (where minidump)
+is supported from the firmware) connected to x86_64 host PC running PCAT
+tool. It supports downloading the minidump produced from product to the
+host PC over USB or to save the minidump to the product attached storage
+device(UFS/eMMC/SD Card) into minidump dedicated partition.
+
+By default, dumps are downloaded via USB to the attached x86_64 PC running
+PCAT (Qualcomm tool) software. Upon download, we will see a set of binary
+blobs starting with name ``md_*`` in PCAT configured directory in x86_64
+machine, so for above example from the client it will be ``md_REGION_A.BIN``.
+This binary blob depends on region content to determine whether it needs
+external parser support to get the content of the region, so for simple
+plain ASCII text we don't need any parsing and the content can be seen
+just opening the binary file.
+
+To collect the dump to attached storage type, one needs to write appropriate
+value to IMEM register, in that case dumps are collected in rawdump
+partition on the product device itself.

+One needs to read the entire rawdump partition and pull out content to
+save it onto the attached x86_64 machine over USB. Later, this rawdump
+can be passed to another tool (``dexter.exe`` [Qualcomm tool]) which
+converts this into the similar binary blobs which we have got it when
+download type was set to USB, i.e. a set of registered regions as blobs
+and their name starts with ``md_*``.
+
+Replacing the ``dexter.exe`` with some open source tool can be added as future
+scope of this document.

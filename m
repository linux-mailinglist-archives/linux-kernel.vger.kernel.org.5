I take it this means that the LUKS metadata lacks a 'this key is
sealed into the TPM' bit?

Could you elaborate a bit on how the early boot code manages this?

So exposing the physical address of the TPM event log is probably not
what we want here.

Note that the TPM event log table is a Linux/efistub construct,
whereas the TPM final log table actually comes from the firmware
directly. So the former only exists if the EFI stub executed first,
and managed to invoke the TCG protocol etc. OTOH, the TPM final log is
TPM2 only, so it doesn't exist on TPM 1.2

Another thing we need to consider is TDX, which exposes a pseudo-TPM
which does not support sealing, along with a CC protocol similar to
the TCG2 protocol. This code will use the event log infrastructure as
well: there are discussions going on at the moment whether we can
improve the way these protocols are combined.

So we should define a scope here:
- do we need TPM1.2 support?
- do we need non-EFI boot support?
- do we need to do anything in particular for FDE on TDX, which has a
TPM event log but no TPM is likely to appear.

I am fine with adding a sysfs node under /sys/firmware/efi that
exposes some of this information, e.g.,
linux_efi_tpm_eventlog::version, but not the physical address of the
table.

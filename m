Sure, we should complain further and ask them that such a problem
won't happen again.  I'm 100% for it.

But the fact is that lots of machines have been already shipped with
this ID since long time ago, and 99.99% of them have been running on
Windows.  Hence I expect that the chance to get a corrected ID is very
very low, and waiting for the support on Linux until the correction of
ID actually happens makes little sense; that's my point.

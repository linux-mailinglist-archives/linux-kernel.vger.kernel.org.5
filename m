This patchset is based on Baolu's rbtree patchset,
https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/2/15/147
I mentioned that in the cover-letter (and the base commit tag).

Buggy BIOS dmar table etc doesn't corrupt the rbtree, but might feed rbtree
with inconsistent info about iommu and pci device.

e.g. the device exists, present, but in fact, the device doesn't belong to the
iommu the BIOS table claimed, if devTLB invalidation sent to such target, we
will get ITE too, but here it isn't be handled. we will deal with that case in
other patches.

The key used to index rbtree is device_domain_info->bus, device_domain_info->
devfn, see intel_iommu_probe_device(), these values not always be the same
as pdev, such as the device is vmd/VF etc, here we only handle the case we intend
to handle ---the hot removal of physical device.

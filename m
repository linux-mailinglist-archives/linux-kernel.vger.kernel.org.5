Is the point of MADV_COLLAPSE to replace base pages with PMD-sized pages
in the pagecache for faster lookups?  Or merely to replace them with
something larger, even if it's not PMD sized?

As of 6.6, XFS asks for folios of size min(read/readahead/write_len,
ondisk_mapping_length), so in theory the folio size should roughly
follow the access patterns.  If the goal is merely larger folios, then
we are done here and can move on to some other part of the collapse.

OTOH if the goal is TLB savings, then I suppose you'd actually /want/ to
select a large (but not PMD) folio for collapsing into a PMD sized
folio, right?

e.g.

	if (PageTransCompound(page)) {
		struct page *head = compound_head(page);

		if (head->index != start) {
			/* not sure what _COMPOUND means here... */
			result = SCAN_PAGE_COMPOUND;
			goto out_unlock;
		}

		if (compound_order(head) == HPAGE_PMD_ORDER) {
			result = SCAN_PTE_MAPPED_HUGEPAGE;
			goto out_unlock;
		}

		/* result is still SCAN_SUCCEED, keep going */
	}

I /think/ that would work?  If the largefolio is dirty or not fully
uptodate then collapse won't touch it; and I think fs/iomap handles this
in a compatible way because it won't mark the folio uptodate until all
the blocks have been read, and it marks the folio dirty if any of the
blocks are dirty.

(says me, who doesn't really understand this part of the code.)

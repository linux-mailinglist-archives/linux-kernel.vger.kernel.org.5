Yes, this already happens. First, the mode is set (which sets the CRTC
rate). Next, LDB sets the LVDS rate. Both do not have "access" to the
PLL, because the clocks haven't configured CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT. What
might be a working (but IMHO dirty) hack, is to give the LDB the PLL
clock as input too. Then it could set the PLL, LDB, CRTC rate (CRTC rate
must be set again after PLL is set!).

Probably we could do that (for now) by adding a second (optional) clock
to LDB. If it is set, the LDB driver should also set the LVDS rate on
this clock. This would then be set to the parent PLL.

Yes, you probably could also tie them to one of the other available
PLLs. We "could" also do that automatically, by not setting
CLK_SET_RATE_REPARENT and adapting the clk-divider driver to look for a
better suitable parent. However, I guess the outcome is currently quite
unpredictable, so this would require a lot of additional work. Just to
mention it here too: I created a small spin-off of this series[1] with
the changes of this series which affect the core.

Probably using the optional clock for LDB is a suitable short-term
solution?

Benjamin

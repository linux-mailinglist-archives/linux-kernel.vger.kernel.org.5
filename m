UEFI r2.10, sec N.2.1,, defines CPER_SEV_FATAL, and platform firmware
decides which Error Severity to put in the error record.  I don't see
anything in UEFI about how the OS should handle fatal errors.

ACPI r6.5, sec 18.1, says on fatal uncorrected error, the system
should be restarted to prevent propagation of the error.  For
CPER_SEV_FATAL errors, it looks like ghes_proc() panics even before
trying AER recovery.

I guess your point is that for CPER_SEV_FATAL errors, the APEI/GHES
path always panics but the native path never does, and that maybe both
paths should work the same way?

It would be nice if they worked the same, but I suspect that vendors
may rely on the fact that CPER_SEV_FATAL forces a restart/panic as
part of their system integrity story.

It doesn't seem like the native path should always panic.  If we can
tell that data was corrupted, we may want to panic, but otherwise I
don't think we should crash the entire system even if some device is
permanently broken.

I don't know enough to comment on how Error Severity should be used in
the Generic Error Status Block vs the Generic Error Data Entry.

The only mention of Data Link Protocol Error that looks relevant is
PCIe r6.0, sec 3.6.2.2, which basically says a DLLP with an unexpected
Sequence Number should be discarded:

  For Ack and Nak DLLPs, the following steps are followed (see Figure
  3-21):

    - If the Sequence Number specified by the AckNak_Seq_Num does not
      correspond to an unacknowledged TLP, or to the value in
      ACKD_SEQ, the DLLP is discarded

      - This is a Data Link Protocol Error, which is a reported error
	associated with the Port (see Section 6.2).

So data from that DLLP should not have made it to memory, although of
course the DMA may not have been completed.  But it sounds like you
did see corrupted data written to memory?

I assume it is not reproducible and we have no reason to think the
receiver of the DLLP has a design defect, e.g., it reported the error
but failed to drop the DLLP?

I'm not a hardware engineer, but I'm not yet convinced that a Data
Link Protocol Error should cause a panic because sec 3.6.2.2 suggests
that this error should not cause data corruption.  Certainly willing
to be proved wrong!

Sec 6.2.2.2 talks about fatal vs non-fatal but only in terms of
whether the error affects a particular transaction (non-fatal) or
everything related to a Link (fatal).  Unless there's more detail
elsewhere, I would assume either could corrupt data.

Sec 6.2.7 and 7.8.4.4 suggest the Data Link Protocol Error should be
a fatal error by default.

I don't think Linux changes PCI_ERR_UNC_DLP (unless there's an _HPX or
similar method), so I would expect it to be set as fatal.

Does this mean the register is mapped incorrectly, e.g., I see arm64
has many different kinds of mappings for cacheability,
write-buffering, etc?

Or, if it is already mapped correctly, are we confident that none of
the *other* register writes need similar treatment?  Is there a rule
we can apply to know when the read-after-write is needed?

I apologize for my delayed response.  It took me almost a month to
nearly fully recover from some really nasty flu that eventually went
into my lungs.  It was awful and I'm still not back to my 100%. :(

Thank you for your work and for your detailed response.  Please see my
comments below, which apply to your v2 submission as a well, to which
I'll respond separately a bit later.

Ah, I see now, thanks for reminding;  it's all described on page 1,372
of the first part of the RK3588 TRM v1.0.

Having that in mind, I'd suggest that we end up naming it 
package_thermal.
The temperature near the center of the chip is usually considered to be
the overall package temperature;  for example, that's how the 
user-facing
CPU temperatures are measured in the x86_64 world.

I agree, it's better to fully utilize the higher measurement granularity
made possible by having multiple temperature sensors available.

I also agree that we should have only the critical trip defined for the
package-level temperature sensor.  Let's have the separate temperature
measurements for the CPU (sub)clusters do the thermal throttling, and
let's keep the package-level measurement for the critical shutdowns 
only.
IIRC, some MediaTek SoC dtsi already does exactly that.

Of course, there are no reasons not to have the critical trips defined
for the CPU (sub)clusters as well.

It should perhaps be the best to have "passive", "hot" and "critical"
trips defined for all three CPU groups/(sub)clusters, separately of
course, to have even higher granularity when it comes to the resulting
thermal throttling.

I think we shouldn't make any assumptions of how the CPU cores heat up
and affect each other, because we don't really know the required 
details.
Instead, we should simply define the reasonable values for the 
"passive",
"hot" and "critical" trips, and leave the rest to the standard thermal
throttling logic.  I hope you agree.

In the end, that's why we have separate thermal sensors available.

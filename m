Furthermore the devres action for dwc_pcie_pmu_remove_cpuhp_instance() is apparently going for even more style points at module exit by not even relying on the corresponding .remove callback of the tenuous platform driver to undo what its .probe did, but (ab)using the device's devres list to avoid having to keep track of an explicit list of PMU instances at all.

It's really not, though. We have a weird singleton platform device 
appearing out of nowhere which effectively represents the module being 
loaded, rather than anything about the actual underlying hardware. If 
you want this to look like "normal" driver model usage, then create a 
separate platform device for each physical PCI PMU instance you discover 
(potentially via both a one-time scan at module_init and an ADD_DEVICE 
hotplug notifier later), then have the platform driver just register the 
corresponding PMU device in .probe and unregister it in .remove, without 
confusing devres action tricks.

Thanks,
Robin.

Conversely if it isn't, why pretend to handle it being removed? Even if it's not to do with physical hotplug of the PMU but with the user unloading the PCI controller driver itself (since there's no module/driver-level dependency enforced) and thus tearing down the whole PCI bus, then the same point still applies - if that *can* happen, then what if the user then re-loads it again, or indeed if this module loads first to begin with; wouldn't we want to be able to (re-)discover the PMUs rather than leave the whole PMU driver degraded to a useless state?

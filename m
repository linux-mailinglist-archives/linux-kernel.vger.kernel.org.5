The TL;DR summary is that the regmap_noinc_write spills over the data
that are correctly written to the HW also to the following registers in
the regcache. As a result, regcache then contains user-controlled
garbage which will be used later for bit updates on unrelated registers.

This patch is a "wrong" fix; a real fix would involve fixing regmap
and/or regcache, but that code has too many indirections for my little
mind.

I was investigating a regression that happened somewhere between 5.12.4
(plus 14 of our patches) and v6.5.9 (plus 7 of our patches). Our
MAX14830 UART would work fine the first time, but when our application
opens the UART the second time it just wouldn't send anything over the
physical TX pin. With the help of a logical analyzer, I found out that
the kernel was sending value 0xcd to the MODE1 register, which on this
chip is a request to set the UART's TX pin to the Hi-Z mode and to
switch off RX completely. That's certainly not the intention of the
code, but that's what I was seeing on the physical SPI bus, and also in
the log when I instrumented the regmap layer.

It turned out that one of the *data* bytes which were sent over the UART
was 0xdd, and that this *data byte* somehow ended up in the regcache's
idea about the value within the MODE1 register. When the UART is opened
up the next time and max310x_startup updates a single unrelated bit in
MODE1, that code consults the regcache, notices the 0xdd data byte in
there, and ends up sending 0xcd over SPI.

Here's what dump_stack() shows:

 max310x spi1.2: regcache_write: reg 0x9 value 0xdd
 max310x spi1.2: PWNED

  process_one_work from worker_thread+0x50/0x54c
  worker_thread from kthread+0xe0/0xfc
  kthread from ret_from_fork+0x14/0x28

Clearly, regmap_noinc_write of a register 0x00 (that's the TX FIFO on
this chip) has no business updating register 0x09, but that's what was
happening here. The regmap_config is already set up in a way that
register 0x00 is marked precious and volatile, so it has no business
going through the cache at all. Also, the documentation for
regmap_noinc_write suggests that this driver was using the regmap
infrastructure correctly, and that the real bug is somewhere in
regmap/regcache where a call to regmap_noinc_write end up updating an
unrelated register in regcache.

Until regmap/regcache is fixed, let's just use an adapted version of the
old code that bypasses regmap altogether, and just sends out an SPI
transaction.

This is related to my commit 3f42b142ea1171967e40e10e4b0241c0d6d28d41
("serial: max310x: fix IO data corruption in batched operations") which
introduced usage of regmap_noinc_write() to this driver. That commit is
a fixup of commit 285e76fc049c4d32c772eea9460a7ef28a193802 ("serial:
max310x: use regmap methods for SPI batch operations") which started
using regmap_raw_write(), which was however also a wrong function.

Fixes: 285e76fc049c ("serial: max310x: use regmap methods for SPI batch operations")

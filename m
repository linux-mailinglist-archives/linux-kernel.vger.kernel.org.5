Rafael could answer this better than I can, but
Documentation/power/suspend-and-interrupts.rst says device interrupts
are generally disabled during suspend after the "late" phase of
suspending devices, i.e.,

  dpm_suspend_noirq
    suspend_device_irqs           <-- disable non-wakeup IRQs
    dpm_noirq_suspend_devices
      ...
        pci_pm_suspend_noirq      # (I assume)
	  pci_prepare_to_sleep

I think the downstream component would be put in D3cold by
pci_prepare_to_sleep(), so non-wakeup interrupts should be disabled by
then.

I assume PME would generally *not* be disabled since it's needed for
wakeup, so I think any interrupt that shares the PME IRQ and occurs
during suspend may cause a spurious wakeup.

If so, it's exactly as you said at the beginning: AER/DPC/etc sharing
the PME IRQ may cause spurious wakeups, and we would have to disable
those other interrupts at the source, e.g., by clearing
PCI_ERR_ROOT_CMD_FATAL_EN etc (exactly as your series does).

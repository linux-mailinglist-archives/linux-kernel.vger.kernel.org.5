I don't think a device in D3cold can signal its own errors.  But the
link transition to L2/L3 as a device goes to D3cold may cause the
bridge above to log an error.  And of course a config access to a
device in D3cold will probably result in an Unsupported Request being
logged by the bridge above it.  I think these are the sorts of errors
we do need to avoid or ignore somehow.

But Configuration and Message requests definitely happen in D3hot, and
they can cause errors reported via AER.  The spec (r6.0, sec 2.2.8)
recommends that Messages be handled the same in D0-D3hot.

PTM is an example of where we had errors being reported at suspend/
resume because we had it configured incorrectly.  If we disabled AER
in D3hot we might not learn about that kind of configuration problem.
That's what makes me think there's some value in keeping AER enabled
in D3hot.

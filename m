But my point is that this sequence doesn't guarrantee that the TLB doesn't read
the page table half way through the SW clearing the 16 entries; a TLB entry can
be ejected for other reasons than just issuing a TLBI. So in that case these 2
flows can be equivalent. Its the fact that we are unsetting the valid bit when
clearing each pte that guarantees this to be safe.

Just because you found a pte that maps a page from a large folio, that doesn't
mean that all pages from the folio are mapped, and it doesn't mean they are
mapped contiguously. We have to deal with partial munmap(), partial mremap()
etc. We could split in these cases (and in future it might be sensible to try),
but that can fail (due to GUP). So we still have to handle the corner case.

But I can imagine doing a batched version of ptep_get_and_clear(), like I did
for ptep_set_wrprotects(). And I think this would be an improvement.

The reason I haven't done that so far, is because ptep_get_and_clear() returns
the pte value when it was cleared and that's hard to do if batching due to the
storage requirement. But perhaps you could just return the logical OR of the
dirty and young bits across all ptes in the batch. The caller should be able to
reconstitute the rest if it needs it?

What do you think?

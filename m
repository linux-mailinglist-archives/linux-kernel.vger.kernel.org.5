Yes, I am agreed that checking is still needed whatever the proposal is.

Yes, as above, skb_frags_not_readable() checking is still needed for
kmap() and page_address().

get_page, put_page related calling is avoided in page_pool_frag_ref()
and napi_pp_put_page() for devmem page as the above checking is true
for devmem page:
(pp_iov->pp_magic & ~0x3UL) == PP_SIGNATURE

page->_refcount is the same as page_pool_iov->_refcount for devmem, which
is ensured by the 'PAGE_POOL_MATCH(_refcount, _refcount);', and
page_pool_iov->_refcount is set to one in mp_dmabuf_devmem_alloc_pages()
by calling 'refcount_set(&ppiov->_refcount, 1)' and always remains as one.

So the 'page_ref_count(page) == 1' checking is always true for devmem page.

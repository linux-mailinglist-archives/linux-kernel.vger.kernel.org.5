I'm sorry that this conclusion may be arbitrary. It might just only suit
for my case. In my case, I traced it loop twice every time before checking
nr_reclaimed, and it reclaimed less than my request size(1G) every time.
So I think the upper bound is 2 * request. But now it seems that this is
related to cgroup tree I constucted and my system status and my request
size(a relatively large chunk). So there are many influencing factors,
a specific upper bound is not accurate.

Yes, I agreed completely that the bigger the request the bigger the
absolute overreclaim error. The focus now is the tradeoff between 
accurate reclaim and efficient reclaim. I think TJ's test is suggestive.

ASPM is a PCIe feature that applies to the PCIe Links between 00:02.0
and 01:00.0 (the first 1068E) and 00:15.0 and 08:00.0 (the second
1068E).

PWDIS is a feature on the SATA cables between the SAS1068E adapters
and the SSDs.

PWDIS/P3 should not be related to ASPM.  I assume you're referring to
the "disabling ASPM on pre-1.1 PCIe device" message.  That should
happen with both the old r3.0 HDDs and the new r3.3 SSDs.

I wish I had some good ideas for you, but I don't know anything about
the SATA side.  I googled for "1068 ssd sata 1.5 gb/s" and found a few
hints about system firmware, LSI firmware, etc, but nothing concrete.

I think some controllers have a BIOS setup user interface; have you
poked around in there?

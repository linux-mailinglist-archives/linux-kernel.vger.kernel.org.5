Hi,

I have a question, maybe I missed something since I haven't read all
the earlier versions.

IIUC, the problem here is that "zswap_entry" has different memcg and node
than the "page", so I wonder if we can just charge "zswap_entry" to the
same memcg of the "page".

Like we can do these when allocating the "zswap_entry":

	old_memcg = set_active_memcg(memcg)
	kmem_cache_alloc_lru(zswap_entry_cache, lru, gfp)
	set_active_memcg(old_memcg)

The good points are:

1. "zswap_entry" is charged to the memcg of "page", which is more sensible?

2. We can reuse the kmem_cache_alloc_lru() interface, which makes code simpler
   since we don't need to manage list_lru_memcg by ourselves.

3. Maybe the new list_lru_add() and list_lru_del() are not needed anymore?
   Since the "zswap_entry" is of the same memcg and node with the "page".
   But don't know if THP shrinker still need it.

Thanks!

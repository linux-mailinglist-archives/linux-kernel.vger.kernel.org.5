OK. The next paragraph already covers this to some extent, but i'll
add some more prose here to clarify it further.

OK

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ardb/linux.git/log/?h=x86-efistub-cleanup-v8

I'll prepare the v8 based on this branch after doing some more tests
on bare metal. I'll probably send it out later today.

It depends on the timing. If we take the whole thing now, it should
ideally go through -tip.

There is a conflict with the kexec sev patch you just suggested on the
list, though. I'll rebase onto that in any case, but if that causes
any problems, we might decide to take everything except the last two
(or three *) patches now, and defer those for later.

* 'efi/libstub: Add limit argument to efi_random_alloc()' may conflict
with some changes that may arrive via the RISC-V tree. That patch is
completely independent, so perhaps I should put it on a shared stable
branch in the EFI tree. Or alternatively, depending on how you decide
to organize the branches, you could put it at the beginning of the
topic branch where the RISC-V tree can merge it in.

Or we might just ignore the conflict - it just adds a function
argument to a function call that gets moved from one source file to
the another in the conflicting branch, so it should be rather
straight-forward to resolve.

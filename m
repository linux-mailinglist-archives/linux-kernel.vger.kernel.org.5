Sorry for the late response, after the internal discussion, I can continue =
on this patch. These 2 points are easy to change, I will also do some xfste=
st for EXT4 and run BMS on RDS environment to do a quick verify.  We can ch=
ange num_active_cpus() to 0. Why adding that: just because during fio test,=
 the max active number goes to ~50 we won't see this issue. But this is not=
 necessary. I will see what's Oleg's opinion later offline.

Thanks,
Davina

It seems there is a API to acquire the DMA mask used by the device:
https://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v6.4-rc6/source/include/linux/dma-mapping.h#L434

Is it possible to use that to check if DMA mask used by the device is
within 32 + PAGE_SHIFT limit, if yes, we use jakub's proposal to reduce
reduce the dma address bit, if no, we fail the page_pool creation?

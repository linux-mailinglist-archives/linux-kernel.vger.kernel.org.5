I just tried to run LKP and xfstests, firstly failed to run LKP on my server
which seems to miss some dependencies. Then I ran xfstests successfully.

But xfstests generic/704 always pass and no WARN in dmesg. (I don't know why,
maybe my server settings are some different from the test robot.)

So I try to reproduce it manually. Steps:

```
echo mq-deadline > /sys/block/sdb/queue/scheduler

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb
mount /dev/sdb /fs/sdb
cd /fs/sdb
stress-ng --symlink 4 --timeout 60

echo none > /sys/block/sdb/queue/scheduler
```

This way the WARNING in mq-deadline can be reproduced easily.

Then retest with the diff, mq-deadline WARNING still happened... So there
are still other requests which have RQF_USE_SCHED flag completed without
being inserted into elevator.

Will use some tracing and look again.

Thanks.

Then we should just return -ENOMEM from sgx_init() when sgx cgroup  
initialization fails?
I thought we only disable SGX cgroup support. SGX can still run.

Setting capacity to zero also confuses user space. Some application may  
rely on this file to know the capacity.

It changes/overrides the the original meaning of capacity==0: no one can  
allocate if capacity is zero.

It's a workaround because you use the capacity==0 but it does not really  
mean to disable the misc cgroup for specific resource IIUC.

There is explicit way for user to disable misc without setting capacity to  
zero. So in future if we want really disable sgx_epc cgroup specifically  
we should not use capacity.  Therefore your approach is not  
extensible/reusable.

Given this is a rare corner case caused by configuration, we can only do  
as much as possible IMHO, not trying to implement a perfect solution at  
the moment. Maybe BUG_ON() is more appropriate?

(If you want to disable sgx, we can return error from sgx_init() but I  
still doubt that's what you meant.)

Thanks

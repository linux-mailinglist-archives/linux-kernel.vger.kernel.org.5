You don't need to do it all at once.  AFAIK the io_dir changes are independent
and you can separate map/maps changes from others.  Maybe you can wait
for map changes merged before working on the dso changes.  I know it'd take
more time but it'd be easier to deal with smaller patches focusing on a single
factor both for you and the reviewers.

p.s. I know I also have a set of ~50 patches and feel sorry about saying
like this. ;-p  Maybe I need to split the data type profiling series too.

Thanks,

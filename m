Bjorn only mentioned to me off-list that that something was wrong with
PCI in linux-next and that it prevented us from reaching the sync state.
So there is no URL to a public report to link to.

I think that adding the corresponding Reported-by tags and Links after
my SoB below should be enough to credit reports that I was not aware of
when investigating this.

But if you decide to rewrite this paragraph, then please spell out "for
example" as I would not use "e.g." outside of parentheses.

Looks like you've "sorted" the trailers here instead of keeping the
temporal order (which would make it more clear what you added after I
posted the patch) and adding each Link after its corresponding
Reported-by tag (e.g. as suggested by checkpatch these days).

So how did you observe it? If the error message does not propagate
to the root bridge, I think no AER interrupt will be trigger.

IMHO, a general model is that error detected at endpoint should be
routed to upstream port for example: RCiEP route error message to RCEC,
so that the AER port service could handle the error, the device driver
only have to implement error handler callback.

I think it is the responsibility of the device to prevent the spread of
errors while reporting that errors have been detected. For example, drop
the current, (drain submit queue) and report error in completion record.
Both NMI and MSI are asynchronous interrupts.

How the kernel crash after a link down? Did the system detect a surprise
down error?

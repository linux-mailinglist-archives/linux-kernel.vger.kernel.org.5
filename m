That's because arm64 doesn't support FTRACE_WITH_REGS anymore. Their
function handlers only care about the arguments. If you want full regs at
function entry, then you need to take a breakpoint hit for a full kprobe.

In fact, fprobes isn't even supported on arm64 because it it doesn't have
DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS. I believe that was the reason Masami was trying
to get it to work with ftrace_regs. To get it to work on arm64.

Again, ftrace_get_regs(fregs) is only suppose to return something if the
pt_regs is fully supplied. If they are not, then it must not be used. Are
you not using a fully filled pt_regs? Because that's what both Thomas and
Peter (also added) told me not to do!

Otherwise, ftrace_regs() has support on arm64 for getting to the argument
registers and the stack. Even live kernel patching now uses ftrace_regs().

Then use kprobes. When I asked Masami what the difference between fprobes
and kprobes was, he told me that it would be that it would no longer rely
on the slower FTRACE_WITH_REGS. But currently, it still does.

The reason I started the FTRACE_WITH_ARGS (which gave us ftrace_regs) in
the first place, was because of the overhead you reported to me with
ftrace_regs_caller and why you wanted to go the direct trampoline approach.
That's when I realized I could use a subset because those registers were
already being saved. The only reason FTRACE_WITH_REGS was created was it
had to supply full pt_regs (including flags) and emulate a breakpoint for
the kprobes interface. But in reality, nothing really needs all that.

ftrace_regs gives you the stack pointer. Basically, it gives you access to
anything that is required to be saved to do a function call from fentry.

Then I recommend that you give up using fprobes and just stick with kprobes
as that's guaranteed to give you full pt_regs (at the overhead of doing
things like filing in flags and such). And currently for arm64, fprobes can
only work with ftrace_regs, without the full pt_regs.

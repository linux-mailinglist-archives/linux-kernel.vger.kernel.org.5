-Wreturn is missing

With the kernel doc in the C file you may also comment the internal ones and
generate documentation only for exported ones. This is not possible with h.

Mostly about the latter.

Then why they are signed? Please, justify that.
Signdness prone to subtle and hard to hunt errors due to integer promotions.

Yes, but we have some guarantees. E.g., we don't include compiler*.h
when types.h is included, because of the guarantees.

Otherwise your code misses _a lot_ of headers.

Signdness is a beast in C, needs always an additional justification.

Yes.

OK!

Correct.

Yes, one is widely used constant and one is a _localized_ helper.

Your choice. Mu point, just do prefix it with something meaningful.

It's a common practice even outside of Linux kernel to use sizeof() against
char arrays. I don't see the point to have the ARRAY_SIZE() complication here.

You see, if you grep for similar calls I'm pretty sure the order of 2 of power
of 10 will be the difference between sizeof()/ARRAY_SIZE() if the latter even
occurs at least once.

Well, technically I already gave some (minor) feedback on this exact patch, and
it's not yet been addressed:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20231005022707.GA1688@quark.localdomain/

Of course, it would also be nice if the commit message mentioned what the patch
actually does.

At a higher level, I've said before, I'm not super happy about the use of
fsverity builtin signatures growing.  (For some of the reasons why, see the
guidance in the fsverity documentation at
https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/fsverity.html#built-in-signature-verification)
That being said, if the people who are doing the broader review of IPE believe
this is how its fsverity integration should work, I can live with that; I don't
intend to block the IPE patchset if enough people want it to be merged.  I've
really been hoping to see engagement with the people involved in IMA, as IPE
basically duplicates/replaces IMA.  But I haven't seen that, so maybe things
need to move on without them.

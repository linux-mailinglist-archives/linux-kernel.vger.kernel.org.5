Hmm. After looking at this problem in detail, it looks to me that you can still
use DT but not with the property you proposed. Since these are hardware modes,
you can have a single DT property that specifies the mode that the driver can
use to configure the hw. It is similar to "phy-mode" property we have for the
network controllers.

So you should have the property defined as below in binding:

brcm,clkreq-mode:
  $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
  enum: [ 0, 1, 2 ]

Then create definition for each mode in "include/dt-bindings/pci/brcm,stb.h".

#define BRCM_STB_CLKREQ_CLOCK_PM	0
#define BRCM_STB_CLKREQ_L1SS		1
#define BRCM_STB_CLKREQ_ON		2

If the property is not specified, the driver should use "Clock PM" as the
default mode as it was doing earlier.

Also, I think you can get rid of other checks in the driver (like PCIEASPM
Kconfig, clkreq_seen etc...) and solely rely on this property to set the mode.

What do you think?

Two argument version of pci_bus_for_each_resource() is quite new (so=20
either 6.6 or 6.7). If want to attempt to compile in 5.15.x, you need=20
this:

include/linux/limits.h:#define RESOURCE_SIZE_MAX        ((resource_size_t)~=
0)

And to add one extra argument into pci_bus_for_each_resource(bus, r) in=20
pbus_upstream_assigned_limit():

=09...
=09while ((bus =3D bus->parent)) {
+=09=09unsigned int i;
=09=09if (pci_is_root_bus(bus))
=09=09=09break;

-=09=09pci_bus_for_each_resource(bus, r) {
+=09=09pci_bus_for_each_resource(bus, r, i) {

Note I've written this "patch" by hand inline so patch command cannot=20
apply it but you need to edit those in.

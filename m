It is purely based on code inspection, and honestly I don't have
numbers to support it. I saw something wrong with the code and I tried
to fix it, I was working on something else when I noticed it. That
being said, I acknowledge it's not making the code any prettier :)

Feel free to suggest improvements to the code to make it more
bearable, otherwise if you don't like it I will just leave it to be
honest.

Thanks for taking a look!

Thanks for that, since this is really EFI related rather than x86.

Well, yes, but just because sanity exists, doesn't mean we can ignore
the current insanity in the Laptop/desktop x86 space.

The problem, as I see it, is if the distros give the kernel an .sbat
section, that means any vanilla kernel that's built by a user and
signed by their key now won't work (even if their key is in MoK)
because it won't have an sbat section ... and the sbat mechanism is
component specific, not key specific, so the signer has no choice but
to adopt it.

There are two ways out of this: give the kernel an sbat section that's
always current, which is what the proposed patch does (but rather falls
down on the who keeps it current and how part) or actually add sbat
addition to the signing tools, so people who sign their own kernels can
simply go on doing that and no-one else need worry.

I rather incline to the latter, but as a maintainer of a secure boot
signing tool I would say that.  I could easily add tools that tell
someone what the current SBAT level is on the machine they're using, or
in any given boot component, which will make it very easy to add the
correct one.  If it becomes the responsibility of the signer, they're
the ones who decide whether what they've signed revokes everything else
(which they'd never realistically do if they want to keep booting
distro kernels in addition to their own).

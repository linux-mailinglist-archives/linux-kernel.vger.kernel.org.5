Indeed, if anything it should be even simpler since you don't need to 
worry about specific sizes at all - any tricky boundary you don't want 
to iterate through, just return short at that point and let the core 
call you back again with the remainder.

(In fact this reminds me one of the low-priority cleanup jobs 
outstanding was to trivially convert all the remaining drivers and 
retire the old interfaces altogether)

Cheers,
Robin.

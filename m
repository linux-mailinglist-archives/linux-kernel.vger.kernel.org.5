Could be similar in the sense that this problem exists on any
discoverable bus with non-discoverable devices downstream.

The LAN9662 case is that it's an SoC that can run Linux. Standard
stuff there. You have a DT and a bunch of drivers and SoC support in
the kernel. Now take that same SoC with the CPU cores disabled and
expose the whole (or part of) SoC via PCIe to Linux running on another
host. How to reuse all the drivers? Yes, you could define swnode
stuff, but then the PCI driver becomes a board file (or multiple). In
fact that's what they started doing at one point. It doesn't scale.

I don't understand what you are asking for.

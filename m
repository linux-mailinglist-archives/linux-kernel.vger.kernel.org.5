Right in these words: "If we use it as dwc private resource." I never
said it should have been DWC-only feature. I explicitly stated that
the solution would be portable across various devices:

I bet this won't be that easy. PCIe subsystem code will need to be fixed
too, at least the devm_of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources() method and
subordinates.

PCIe-spec != DT-spec.

So is a lot of other controllers:
Rockchip PCIe controller (see pcie-rockchip.h AXI_WRAPPER_* macros)
Cadence PCIe controller (see pcie-cadence.h CDNS_PCIE_AT_OB_REGION_DESC0_TYPE_* macros)
Mediatek PCIe Gen3 controller (see pcie-mediatek-gen3.c PCIE_ATR_TLP_TYPE() macro)
..

Moreover as you said yourself PCIe-spec doesn't define "regions". It's
always about TLPs. IO, MEM, CFG, INTx, PME, Vendor-defined, etc all is
kind of TLPs. Yet at least the first three are described by the
"ranges" DT-property.

Anyway let's look further in the PCIe-spec. Please note paragraph
2.1.1. of for instance the PCIe-4.0 spec:

2.1.1  Address Spaces, Transaction Types, and Usage
"Transactions form the basis for information transfer between a
Requester and Completer. Four _address spaces_ are defined, and
different Transaction types are defined, each with its own unique
intended usage, as shown in Table 2-12."

Address Space     | Transaction Types    |  Basic Usage
Memory            | Read/Write           | Transfer data to/from a
                  |                      | memory-mapped location
I/O               | Read/Write           | Transfer data to/from an
                  |                      | I/O-mapped location
Configuration     | Read/Write           | Device Function config/setup
_Message_         | Baseline (including  | From event signaling mechanism
                  | Vendorâ€“Defined)      | to general purpose messaging

So basically the PCIe-spec defines four _address spaces_. The
_message_ space is one of them. Seeing the "ranges" DT-property is
about the space-to-space mapping there is nothing wrong with using it
for the _message_ space mapping.

So can be, and originally was, done for the PCI config-space access.
See Mediatek PCIe controller (see pcie-mediatek.c
mtk_pcie_hw_wr_cfg()/mtk_pcie_hw_rd_cfg()) and more than half of the
drivers/pci/controllers/pci-*.c drivers. Yet we have the DT-spec
defining the PCIe-"ranges" property with the config-space mapping.

Moreover DW PCIe controllers perform the mem-to-tlp translation in the
AHB/AXI-bridge module. If not for that the address space transactions
are generated by means of the XALI/TRGT interfaces, which is a set of
the wires/signals. They can be used by the device engineers to
implement _any_ interface they wish for _any address space_. So
basically the memory, I/O and config-space transfers can be
theoretically implemented by the indirect CSRs IO in hardware. Another
story is who would wish to do that if there is a ready-to-use and
handy AXI/AHB bridges with simple memory-based interface...

Rob didn't like _your_ interpretation of the suggested approach.

Anyway the implementation may look as follows:

ranges = <0x82000000 0 0x00000000 0 0xe0000000 0 0x10000000>, /* mem */
         <0x81000000 0 0x10000000 0 0xf0000000 0 0x00010000>, /* io */
         <0x80000000 0 0x10010000 0 0xf0010000 0 0x00010000>, /* cfg */
         <0x84000000 0 0x10020000 0 0xf0020000 0 0x00010000>; /* mem - note new space code 0x4 */

So the "cfg" region can be used instead of the "config" reg-name (a
more correct replacement for that), and the "mem" region with not-yet
defined space code could be utilized for various message TLPs
described in the "2.2.8 Message Request Rules" paragraph (PCIe 4.0
spec). We can go further and define various message-mapping like INTx,
PM, Vendor-specific, Locked transaction, etc, which IMO would be
better than using a single type for all kinds of the messages seeing
PCIe-spec have them described.. But it's better to get the Rob and
Bjorn opinion about the _actual_ suggestion first.

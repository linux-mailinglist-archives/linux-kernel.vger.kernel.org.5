I am not sure I understand.

The problem is that when you skip when someone else is flushing, there
is a chance that the stats we care about haven't been flushed since
the last time the periodic flusher ran. Which is supposed to be ~2
seconds ago, but maybe more depending on how busy the workqueue is.

When you block until the flusher finishes, the stats are being
refreshed as you wait. So the stats are not getting more outdated as
you wait in the general case (unless your cgroup was flushed first and
you're waiting for others to be flushed).
[Let's call this approach A]

Furthermore, with the implementation you suggested using a mutex, we
will wait until the ongoing flush is completed, then we will grab the
mutex and do a flush ourselves. That second flush should mostly be
very fast, but it will guarantee even fresher stats.
[Let's call this approach B]

See below for test results with either A or B.

We can add a new API that checks if the specific cgroup we care about
is flushed and wait on that instead of waiting for the entire flush to
finish, which will add stronger guarantees. However, as you said when
you suggested the mutex approach, let's start simple and add more
complexity when needed.

Very good question, I should have added numbers since the beginning to
clarify the significance of the problem. To easily produce numbers I
will use another use case that we have that relies on having fresh
stats, which is proactive reclaim. Proactive reclaim usually operates
in a feedback loop where it requests some reclaim, queries the stats,
and decides how to operate based on that (e.g. fallback for a while).

When running a test that is proactively reclaiming some memory and
expecting to see the memory swapped, without this patch, we see
significant inaccuracy. In some failure instances we expect ~2000
pages to be swapped but we only find ~1200. This is observed on
machines with hundreds of cpus, where the problem is most noticeable.
This is a huge difference. Keep in mind that the inaccuracy would
probably be even worse in a production environment if the system is
under enough pressure (e.g. the periodic flusher is late).

For both approach A (wait until flusher finishes and exit, i.e this
patch) and approach B (wait until flusher finishes then flush, i.e the
mutex approach), I stop seeing this failure in the proactive reclaim
test and the stats are accurate.

I have v2 ready that implements approach B with the mutex ready to
fire, just say the word :)

100% agreed. It's more difficult to get testing results for this, but
that can easily be the case when we have no idea how much is flushed
when we return from mem_cgroup_flush_stats().

This wouldn't be my first option, but if that's the only way to get
accurate stats I'll take it.

Keep in mind that the normal stats read path will always try to
refresh, it's just that it will often skip refreshing due to an
implementation-specific race. So having an interface for an explicit
flush might be too implementation specific, especially if the race
disappears later and the interface is not needed later.

Having said that, I am not opposed to this if that's the only way
forward for accurate stats, but I would rather have the stat reads be
always accurate unless a regression is noticed.

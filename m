I can put it available under root too, don't think there is any 
technical reason to not have it. In fact, now that I look at it again, 
memory.stat is present on root so that would align with my general 
guideline to keep the two as similar as possible.

Yeah that's ugly. I could eliminate cgroup_lock by being a bit smarter. 
Just didn't think it worth it for the RFC.

Basically to account memory stats for any sub-tree I need the equivalent 
one struct drm_memory_stats per DRM device present in the hierarchy. So 
I could pre-allocate a few and restart if run out of spares, or 
something. They are really small so pre-allocating a good number, based 
on past state or something, should would good enough. Or even total 
number of DRM devices in a system as a pessimistic and safe option for 
most reasonable deployments.

You mean the fact there are different categories is not a value add for 
your use case because you would only use one?

The idea was to align 1:1 with DRM memory stats fdinfo and somewhat 
emulate how memory.stat also offers a breakdown.

Ah that would be a challenge indeed to which I don't have any answers 
right now.

Hm if you have a DRM device somewhere in the chain memory stats would 
still show up. Like if you had a dma-buf producer which is not a DRM 
driver, but then that buffer was imported by a DRM driver, it would show 
up in a cgroup. Or vice-versa. But if there aren't any in the whole 
chain then it would not.

Not all all, good feedback!

At least, the part that communicates with (1) is necessary, but I don't 
know if
the current implementation is appropriate. In addition, there is a 
performance
issue, so I am currently investigating QEMU more. e.g. pci emulation, 
shared-memory, etc.

I'd like to improve and submit a next rfc.

Thanks,

I failed to find any signal indicating the OBFF messages reception.
There is only the explicitly described SII OBFF Message Generation
Signals. Anyway it's not that important. It might be some
Rockchip-specific RTL block detecting incoming OBFF messages.

You can add them to the "interrupts" property describing each array
entry in accordance with the "interrupt-names" items.

I was hoping to avoid that. The snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml schema was
intended to describe the common parts of the DW PCIe Root Port and
End-point DT-bindings and not being used directly. The original idea
behind all the created DW PCIe RP/EP bindings was to bring some order
to the already over-diverged resources naming hell. In case of the
Rockchip PCIe controller we've got only the peculiar interrupt
signals. The rest of the resources comply fine with the generic schema
and it's pretty much hard do decide what solution to select to keep
all the resources described and to use the generic DW PCIe Root Port
DT-bindings.  It would be pity to fallback to using the
snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml schema just because of the interrupt names.

amlogic,axg-pcie.yaml schema already slipped in behind my back (and
BTW contains a bug in the "select" property which makes it not being
selected for the Amlogic PCIe nodes evaluation at all). Since I am not
the driver maintainer that will likely happen again over and over. Sigh...

Anyways if no better solution comes up from Rob or Krzysztof and they
didn't approve any option suggested by me above I guess your
suggestion might be selected then.

And it's a correct way to do since the fallback compatible is not that
useful. In this particular case it's just useless seeing there is a
low-level platform driver for the Rockchip PCIe host controller.

Right. Don't know how come this solution didn't cross my mind that
evening. Anyway indeed it would be useful to have it in the generic DW
PCIe Root Port DT-schema irrespective from the Rockchip PCIe host
controller DT-schema implementation.

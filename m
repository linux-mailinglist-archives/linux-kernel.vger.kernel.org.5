I believe it's the VGA I/O that can't be disabled, there's no means to
do so other than the I/O enable bit in the command register and iirc
the driver depends on this for other features.  The history of this is
pretty old, but here are some links:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/1376486637.31494.19.camel@ul30vt.home/
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=3D1400212#p1400212

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20140509201655.2849.97478.stgit@bling.home/

I think the issue was that i915 doesn't claim to the VGA arbiter to be
controlling legacy VGA ranges, but in fact the hardware does claim
those ranges.  We can "fix" i915 to report that VGA MMIO space is
owned and can be controlled, but then Xorg likely sees multiple VGA
arbiter clients and disables DRI because it wants to mmap VGA MMIO
space.

Therefore unless something has changed in the past 10yrs, i915 owns but
does not advertise ownership of the VGA address spaces and therefore
the arbiter can't and doesn't know to change VGA routing to enable a
"be_primary" path to another device.

That's a convenient and impractical approach.  I expect all Intel HD
graphics has this issue.  Unknown for Xe.

We often need to deal with broken hardware in the kernel.

Then why are we hacking on VGA arbitration in this series at all?

This looks like a pretty significant scoping issue if you're proposing
changes to the VGA arbiter which specifically handles the routing of
legacy VGA address spaces but are not willing to commit to testing
legacy configurations.  Thanks,

Alex

Ah, I don't usually send kernel patches. Forgot to do format.signOff=true.

I committed this while working on my address/ifindex binding patch[1]
(which I will also resend shortly), at the time I thought this fix makes
sense in isolation but apparently not.

It's been a while since I wrote this patch. Unfortunately you didn't
respond to my initial mail in Aug, so some context has already been lost to
time.

I may have been under the mistaken impression that udp_sock_create can
return <0 while leaving *sockp!=NULL, but as I recall it I did re-test with
this patch and it fixed the bug, that I wish I remembered how to trigger
now. Unsatisfying.

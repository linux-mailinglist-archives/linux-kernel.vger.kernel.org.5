Right, so this is another timing problem: we can't autoload modules
*before* they appear in the filesystem and presumably they're on the
initrd, so auto loading must be post initrd mount (and init execution)
but otherwise quite early?

This might be quite a bit of work.  Logically, just moving the matching
and loading code earlier might work, but we used to have a
load_default_modules() at the end of init/main.c and it got removed
(because it only eventually loaded elevator modules) everything is now
loaded in it's various init routines, so to get, say, TPM ACPI modules
loaded earlier, we'd have to run the ACPI device matching code earlier
and so on for every other subsystem ...

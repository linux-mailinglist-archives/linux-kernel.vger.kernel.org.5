Thanks, appreciated.

In fact, lseek() on PCI resource files in sysfs was broken since commit 
636b21b50152. That was the reason why I started to investigate the 
issue: one of our applications stopped working after a kernel update.

I'm not hundred percent sure if it belongs to stable, but it does fix a 
user-visible regression.

Valentin

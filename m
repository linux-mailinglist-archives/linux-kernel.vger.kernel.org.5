On real HW I've seen, RCiEPs don't seem to have these speeds at all 
(PCIe r6.1, sec 7.5.3):

"The Link Capabilities, Link Status, and Link Control registers are 
required for all Root Ports, Switch Ports, Bridges, and Endpoints that are 
not RCiEPs. For Functions that do not implement the Link Capabilities, 
Link Status, and Link Contro registers, these spaces must be hardwired to 
0. Link Capabilities 2, Link Status 2, and Link Control 2 registers are
required for all Root Ports, Switch Ports, Bridges, and Endpoints (except 
for RCiEPs) that implement capabilities requiring those registers. For 
Functions that do not implement the Link Capabilities 2, Link Status 2, 
and Link Control 2 registers, these spaces must be hardwired to 0b."

Intersection is enough at least for bwctrl. The only downside that is 
barely worth mentioning is that the bus SLSV has to be re-read when
function 0 sets the intersection.

I can think of somebody wanting to expose the list of both supported speed 
to userspace though sysfs (not done by this patch series), but they could 
be read from the registers in that case so that use case doesn't really 
matter much, IMO.

Yes. I tend to try to avoid forward references because some maintainers 
complain about them (leading to minimal changes where true motivations 
have to be hidden because "future" cannot be used to motivate a change 
even if that's often the truest motivation within a patch series). But 
I'll add a fwd ref here to make it more obvious. :-)

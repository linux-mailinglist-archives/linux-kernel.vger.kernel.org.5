Sorry, I dragged this out by not giving you a more useful suggestion
to begin with.  Since advk_pcie_valid_device() has the same issue,
copying its comment was a great place to start.

But I think advk_pcie_valid_device(), altera_pcie_valid_device(),
nwl_pcie_valid_device(), xilinx_pcie_valid_device(), and now
xilinx_pl_dma_pcie_valid_device() all have the same race, but none of
them really address it in the comment.

I'm looking for explicit acknowledgement that we can't reliably
prevent this unrecoverable error, e.g., something like this:

  Sending a PIO request to a downstream device when the link is down
  causes an unrecoverable error, and a reset of the entire PCIe
  controller will be needed.  We can reduce the likelihood of that
  unrecoverable error by checking whether the link is up, but can't
  completely prevent it because the link may go down between the
  link-up check and the PIO request.

Bjorn

I think that overlayfs sets SB_POSIXACL unconditionally to ensure that
the upper filesystem can decide where the umask needs to be stripped. If
the upper filesystem doesn't have SB_POSIXACL then the umask will be
stripped directly in e.g., vfs_create(), and vfs_tmpfile(). If it does
then it will be done in the upper filesystems.

So with the patch I linked above that we have in vfs.misc we should be
able to  change overlayfs to behave similar to NFS:

diff --git a/fs/overlayfs/super.c b/fs/overlayfs/super.c
index 9f43f0d303ad..361189b676b0 100644

+       sb->s_iflags |= SB_I_NOUMASK;

        err = -ENOMEM;
        root_dentry = ovl_get_root(sb, ctx->upper.dentry, oe);

Which means that umask handling will be done by the upper filesystems
just as is done right now and overlayfs can stop advertising SB_POSIXACL
support on a kernel that doesn't have support for it compiled in.

How does that sound?

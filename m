That would need more changes in misc cgroup implementation to support  
sgx-disable. Right now misc does not have separate files for different  
resource types. So we can only block echo "sgx_epc..." to those interface  
files, can't really make files not visible.

Anyway, I see this is really a configuration failure case. And we handle  
it without added complexity and do as much as we can gracefully until  
another fatal error happens. So if we need support disable sgx through  
command line in future, then we can also make this failure handling even  
more graceful at that time. Nothing really is lost IMHO.

Originally we put in BUG_ON() but then we changed to handle it based on  
your feedback. I can put BUG_ON() back if we agree that's more appropriate  
at the moment.

@Dave, @Jarkko, @Michal, your thoughts?

Thanks

Thanks for replying.

Our scan interval is 10 minutes and total memory size is 512GB.

In out environment, we found that we take average 0.4 core and 300MB memory
to do scan, basic analyse and reclaim idle pages.

For reducing cpu & memroy usage, we do: 
1. We implement a ratelimiter to control rate of scan and reclaim.
2. All pages info & idle age were stored in local DB file. Our prediction
algorithm don't need all pages info in memory at the same time.

In out environment, about 1/3 memory was attemped to allocate as THP,
which may save some cpu usage of scan.

There is a case:
There are two cgroup A, B (B is child cgroup of A)
Process in A create a file and use mmap to read/write this file.
Process in B mmap this file and usually read this file.

It seems that doesn't work now.

static void inc_max_seq(struct lruvec *lruvec, bool can_swap, bool force_scan)
{
......
    for (type = ANON_AND_FILE - 1; type >= 0; type--) {
        if (get_nr_gens(lruvec, type) != MAX_NR_GENS)
            continue;

        VM_WARN_ON_ONCE(!force_scan && (type == LRU_GEN_FILE || can_swap));

        if (inc_min_seq(lruvec, type, can_swap))
            continue;

        spin_unlock_irq(&lruvec->lru_lock);
        cond_resched();
        goto restart;
    }
.....
}

force_scan is not a parameter of inc_min_seq.
In our environment, swappiness is 0, so can_swap would be false.

static bool inc_min_seq(struct lruvec *lruvec, int type, bool can_swap)
{
    int zone;
    int remaining = MAX_LRU_BATCH;
    struct lru_gen_folio *lrugen = &lruvec->lrugen;
    int new_gen, old_gen = lru_gen_from_seq(lrugen->min_seq[type]);

    if (type == LRU_GEN_ANON && !can_swap)
        goto done;
......
}

If can_swap is false, would pass anon lru list.

What's more, in passive scan, force_scan is also false.

static long get_nr_to_scan(struct lruvec *lruvec, struct scan_control *sc, bool can_swap)
{
......
    /* skip this lruvec as it's low on cold folios */
    return try_to_inc_max_seq(lruvec, max_seq, sc, can_swap, false) ? -1 : 0;
}

Is it a good idea to include a global parameter no_inversion, and modify inc_min_seq
like this:

static bool inc_min_seq(struct lruvec *lruvec, int type, bool can_swap)
{
    int zone;
    int remaining = MAX_LRU_BATCH;
    struct lru_gen_folio *lrugen = &lruvec->lrugen;
    int new_gen, old_gen = lru_gen_from_seq(lrugen->min_seq[type]);

-   if (type == LRU_GEN_ANON && !can_swap)
+   if (type == LRU_GEN_ANON && !can_swap && !no_inversion)
        goto done;
......
}

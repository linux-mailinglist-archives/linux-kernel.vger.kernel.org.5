My rationale is that arm64 is planning to use this for contpte mapping 2MB
blocks for 16K and 64K kernels. But I think we will all agree that allowing 2MB
blocks without the proper THP hinting is a bad plan.

As I see it, arches could add their own arch_wants_pte_order() at any time, and
just because the HW has a preference, doesn't mean the SW shouldn't get a say.
Its a negotiation between HW and SW for the LAF order, embodied in this policy.

I agree that the "obvious reason" is that HW might prefer order-0. But the
performance wins don't come solely from the HW. Batching up page faults is a big
win for SW even if the HW doesn't benefit. So I think it is important that a HW
preference of order-0 is possible to express through this API. But that doesn't
mean that we don't listen to SW's preferences either.

I would really rather leave it in; As I've mentioned in the past, we have a
partner who is actively keen to take advantage of 2MB blocks with 64K kernel and
this is the mechanism that means we don't dole out those 2MB blocks unless
explicitly opted-in.

I'm going to be out on holiday for a couple of weeks, so we might have to wait
until I'm back to conclude on this, if you still take issue with the justification.

Thanks,
Ryan

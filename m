I'm not sure I fully understand you here. I agree that we should avoid
the table if we can, but as you noted below this is what the patch in
this thread does.

And the firmware comes from Qualcomm which pushes it directly to
linux-firmware so we can't control what they decide to put in these
files.

Perhaps the driver can clear the BD_ADDR tag instead of reading it back,
but yes, the end result would be the same in case the firmware can
handle that. May be better to just read out the address as this patch
does to be sure.

Not sure we need to care too much about older kernels here. The patches
are currently marked for backport to 6.5 and that could serve as a
cut-off point, but I guess there is nothing preventing us from
backporting this to all stable trees if you prefer that.

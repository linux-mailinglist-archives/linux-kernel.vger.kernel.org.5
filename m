Thank you!  A BIOS update is almost never the answer because even if
an update exists, we have to assume that most users in the field will
never install the update.

I want to look at the BIOS info in case we can learn about something
*Linux* is doing wrong.  This most likely works fine with Windows, so
I assume Linux is doing something wrong or at least differently than
Windows.

Added by 4eea6aa581ab ("x86, mm: if kernel .text .data .bss are not
marked as E820_RAM, complain and fix").  No idea.  A shame we didn't
include the .text/.data values in the message.

Added by 316253406959 ("x86, intel_txt: Intel TXT boot support").  No
idea about this either.

Both related to arch_rmrr_sanity_check(), added by f036c7fa0ab6
("iommu/vt-d: Check VT-d RMRR region in BIOS is reported as reserved")
and f5a68bb0752e ("iommu/vt-d: Mark firmware tainted if RMRR fails
sanity check").

No idea about this one either.  The VT-d spec (r1.3, sec 8.4) says
"BIOS must report the RMRR reported memory addresses as reserved in
the system memory map returned through methods such as INT15, EFI
GetMemoryMap etc."

arch_rmrr_sanity_check() only looks at your e820 map, which only has
this:

  BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000000009ffff] usable
  BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000000100000-0x00000000d1f36fff] usable

I think Linux basically converts the info from EFI GetMemoryMap
to an e820 format; I think booting with "efi=debug" would show more
details of this.

Anyway, this is all a tangent.

You mean the MB vs KB difference?  That's my fault.  I guess I used KB
for the "Not removing" message because those are smaller (< 256KB) so
the size in MB wouldn't be useful there.  We could use KB for both,
but I guess I used MB for the "Remove" case because it's a little
easier to read and I expected "Not removing" to be a relatively
unusual case.

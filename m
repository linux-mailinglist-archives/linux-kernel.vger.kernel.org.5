It would certainly be nice to have such information in the tree;
"where should I pick $SYMBOL from?" is something one needs to
find out often enough.  To a large extent it's covered by "where
in include/*.h do we have it defined?", but that's not all there
is to it.  E.g. "get_user() => use linux/uaccess.h".

There's also stuff like "$SYMBOL should not be used outside of arch/*
and include/*, better use $OTHER_SYMBOL", etc.

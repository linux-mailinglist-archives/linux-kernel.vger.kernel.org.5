Instead of "This patch ...", prefer imperative mood, i.e.:
"Expose the values in sysfs to allow user space to ..."

What's the purpose of this pointer?  It's set in
pci_doe_sysfs_feature_supports() but never used for anything.

I'm guessing that you meant to use it to tear down the added attributes
on device removal, but that's missing in the patch.

The attributes are added with sysfs_add_file_to_group(), but it seems
to me they're not automatically removed by sysfs_remove_groups() on
device teardown.  Am I missing something?

I don't quite understand the meaning of the function name:
It sounds as if its purpose is to determine whether a feature
is supported.  Maybe something like pci_doe_sysfs_add_features()
instead?


> +	doe_mb->sysfs_attrs = attrs;

Set this after the xa_for_each() loop to avoid having to reset it
to NULL on error.

The purpose of resetting attrs[i].show to NULL in the error path
seems to be that you want to skip over features which haven't
been created as attributes yet.

It seems more straightforward to just iterate over the elements
in attrs[] until you reach one whose mode is 0.

Alternatively, use xa_for_each_range(&doe_mb->feats, i, entry, 0, i - 1).

Rename to pci_doe_sysfs_init() for consistency.

No #ifdef necessary.

Thanks,

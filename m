Noted, thanks for suggesting this, shared schema file indeed looks like
a better idea.

Yes, with the shared schema it should be array instead of integer.

Yes, this was kept as uint32 since with am65x-dss only one plane was
available for sharing, but with the shared schema this too should be an
array instead of integer.

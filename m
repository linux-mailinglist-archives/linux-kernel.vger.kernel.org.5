Sure but for local signing via MoK that's obviously fine, as one gets
to keep the pieces. AFAIK it's a different flow in Shim whether
something is authorized by MoK, DB or the built-in cert, so having
different policies built-in for those different cases should be
doable. Actually at the moment even if Shim loads the image, if it
gets authorized by DB .sbat isn't checked at all.

I meant Shim + 3rd party CA flow here. UEFI SB 2.0 is so far ahead I'm
pretty sure a good chunk of the folks currently talking about it will
be retired by the time it actually exist ;-)

Yup, that's the right thing to do; drivers *shouldn't* use the builtins
directly, and *should* use the kernel's native atomic*() API.

I suspect this is down to your toolchain enabling -moutline-atomics by default;
that expands the builtins into calls to out-of-line functions. I suspect your
cross-compile toolchain doesn't enable that by default.

As above, since nothing should be using the builtins, we don't implement
out-of-line versions nor do we override the option.

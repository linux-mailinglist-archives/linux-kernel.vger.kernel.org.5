FWIW, USB4/Thunderbolt does have kernel code for DMA testing with a
special dongle (drivers/thunderbolt/dma_test.c) as well as code for
lane margining, so there *is* some precedent for that... :)

  config USB4_DEBUGFS_MARGINING
	bool "Expose receiver lane margining operations under USB4 ports (DANGEROUS)"
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	depends on USB4_DEBUGFS_WRITE
	help
	  Enables hardware and software based receiver lane margining support
	  under each USB4 port. Used for electrical quality and robustness
	  validation during manufacturing. Should not be enabled by distro
	  kernels.

Thanks,

Lukas

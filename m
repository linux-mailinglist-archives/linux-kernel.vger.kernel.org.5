Furthermore the devres action for dwc_pcie_pmu_remove_cpuhp_instance() is apparently going for even more style points at module exit by not even relying on the corresponding .remove callback of the tenuous platform driver to undo what its .probe did, but (ab)using the device's devres list to avoid having to keep track of an explicit list of PMU instances at all.

Also provides a (potential) parent for the PMU devices which is something
we were trying to clean up for existing PMUs (which end up in the
wrong directly in sysfs because they typically don't have parents).

Conversely if it isn't, why pretend to handle it being removed? Even if it's not to do with physical hotplug of the PMU but with the user unloading the PCI controller driver itself (since there's no module/driver-level dependency enforced) and thus tearing down the whole PCI bus, then the same point still applies - if that *can* happen, then what if the user then re-loads it again, or indeed if this module loads first to begin with; wouldn't we want to be able to (re-)discover the PMUs rather than leave the whole PMU driver degraded to a useless state?

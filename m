I'm a little bit of not convinced about this idea, you might be correct.
But there cases where three are multiple monitors and each video card
connect one.

It also quite common that no monitors is connected, let the machine boot
first, then find a monitors to connect to a random display output. See
which will display. I don't expect the primary shake with.
The primary one have to be determined as early as possible, because of
the VGA console and the framebuffer console may directly output the primary.
Get the DDC and/or HPD involved may necessary complicated the problem.

There are ASpeed BMC who add a virtual connector in order to able display remotely.
There are also have commands to force a connector to be connected status.

You may be correct, but I'm still not sure.
I probably need more times to investigate.
Me and my colleagues are mainly using X server,
the version varies from 1.20.4 and 1.21.1.4.
Even this is true, the problems still exist for non-modern desktops.

Thanks for you tell me so much knowledge,
I'm realized where are the problems now.
I will try to resolve the concerns at the next version.

Ha - I had it as a separate patch originally, but thought you'd ask for it to be
a single patch so squashed it ;-). I can separate it again, no problem.

Please do. Hopefully the thread with DavidH against v2 gives the rationale. Care
to elaborate on why its unacceptable?

Not sure what you mean? Hugh Dickins' series that went into v6.5-rc1 makes it
possible for pte_offset_map() to fail (if I understood correctly) and we have to
handle this. The intent is that we will return from the fault without making any
change, then we will refault and try again.

There are 38 instances of inline in memory.c alone, so looks like a well used
convention, even if the compiler may choose to ignore. Perhaps you can educate
me; what's the benefit of dropping it?

Great - just incase it wasn't obvious, I decided not to overwrite vmf->address
with the aligned version, as you suggested, for 2 reasons; 1) address is const
in the struct, so would have had to change that. 2) there is a uffd path that
can be taken after the vmf->address fixup would have occured and the path
consumes that member, so it would have had to be un-fixed-up making it more
messy than the way I opted for.

Thanks for the quick review as always!

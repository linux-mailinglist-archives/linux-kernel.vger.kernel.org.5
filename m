Glad to hear that. Could you please explicitly give me you tested-by tag? I could add it in next version.

I had to do a couple of changes though such as adding Ampere vendor ID and support multiple PCIe domains. Given your driver is already in v10 and you have got quite a few reviewed and acked bys, I wonder if it's better to add my changes to your patches or me to create new patches on top of yours? I'm fine with either. Any thoughts?

I prefer new separate patches, so that we can review them in a new loop.

TBH, for perf top I don't know *which* behaviour is preferable, but I agree
that it'd be good for x86 and arm to work in the same way.

For design-cleanliness and consistency with other commands I can see that
opening those separately is probably for the best, but for typical usage of
perf top it's really nice to have those presented together without having to
tab back-and-forth between the distinct PMUs, and so the existing behaviour of
using CPU-bound PERF_EVENT_TYPE_HARDWARE events is arguably nicer for the user.

I don't have a strong feeling either way; I'm personally happy so long as
explicit pmu_name/event/ events don't get silently converted into
PERF_EVENT_TYPE_HARDWARE events, and as long as we correctly set the extended
HW type when we decide to use that.

Thanks,
Mark.

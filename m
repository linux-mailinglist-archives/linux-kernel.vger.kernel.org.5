 Can you post it here for review then, as surely it's a standalone change?

 It is a good question what the sequence of events exactly is that sets 
the LBMS bit.  I don't know the answer offhand.

 Indeed there is.

 If there's an interrupt handler for LBMS events, then it may be the best 
approach if the quirk is triggered by the handler instead, possibly as a 
softirq.

 I've always been confused with the suspend/resume terminology: I'd have 
assumed this would have gone through a power cycle, in which case the LBMS 
bit would have necessarily been cleared in the transition, because its 
required state at power-up/reset is 0, so the value of 1 observed would be 
a result of what has happened solely through the resume stage.  Otherwise 
it may make sense to clear the bit in the course of the suspend stage, 
though it wouldn't be race-free I'm afraid.

 What I refer to is that if you suspend your system, remove the device 
that originally caused the quirk to trigger and then resume your system 
with the device absent, then LBMS couldn't have been set in the course of 
resume, because the port couldn't have come out of the DL_Down status in 
the absence of the downstream device.  Do you interpret it differently?

 Of course once set the bit isn't self-clearing except at power-up/reset.

 That is what I have observed.  It was so long ago I don't remember how I 
calculated the figures anymore, it may have been with a U-Boot debug patch 
made to collect samples (because with U-Boot you can just poll the LT bit 
while busy-looping).  I'd have to try and dig out the old stuff.

 I'll see if I can experiment with the hardware over the next couple of 
days and come back with my findings.

What PCIe transactions are involved here?  So far I know about:

  RC initiates Memory Read Request (or Write) with NO_SNOOP==0
  ...
  EP responds with Completion with Data (for Read) 

But I guess you're saying the EP would initiate other transactions in
the middle related to snooping?  I don't know what those are.

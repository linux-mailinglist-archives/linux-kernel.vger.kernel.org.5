My understanding is that this speedup is all coming from the avoidance of
splitting folios synchonously in the context of madvise(MADV_FREE). It's not
actually punting anymore work to be done lazily, its just avoiding doing extra
uneccessary work up front. In fact, it would result in less work to do at
lazyfree time because the folios remain large so there are fewer folios to free.

Perhaps I've misunderstood your point?

Thanks,
Ryan

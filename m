We would like to enable LPM for Tiger Lake again, but last time we tried
to do so, we got a bunch of reports:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217114
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=283906

Where people complained that their SATA drive dissappeared as a result.


The bug reports were reported on the following hardware:
ASUS Vivobook 15 X513EAN
Lenovo L3-15ITL6 IdeaPad
Acer A515-56-32DK
Acer A514
HP Pavilion 14-dv0589na

Usually, when a single vendor manages to mess something up in their
platform firmware, and we deal with that by adding a quirk for that
specific vendor.

But here it is four different vendors... This kind of suggests that
there could be a some more fundamental LPM related issue at play here.


Yes, we are fully aware that on some other platforms, not having
LPM enabled stops those platforms from entering the lowest CPU power
states. So right now we are doomed if we do enable LPM, doomed if we
don't.

However, having some systems drawing more power than needed is better
than some other systems not detecting their SATA drives at all.

Unfortunately, we don't have any of these laptops that has a Tiger Lake
AHCI controller (with a disappearing drive), so until someone who does
debugs this, I think we are stuck at status quo.


Kind regards,
Niklas

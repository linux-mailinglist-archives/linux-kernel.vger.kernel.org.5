Instead of:

  fits_capacity(unsigned long util, unsigned long capacity)

      return approximate_util_avg(util, TICK_USEC) < capacity;

just make 1280 in:

  #define fits_capacity(cap, max) ((cap) * 1280 < (max) * 1024)

dependent on cpu's capacity_orig or the capacity diff to the next higher
capacity_orig.

Typical example today: {little-medium-big capacity_orig} = {128, 896, 1024}

896รท128 = 7

1024/896 = 1.14

to achieve higher margin on little and lower margin on medium.

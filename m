We do, it happens in coresight_enable_path() which Perf uses. I added
the comment below about that.

The reason coresight_disable_path() skips the first item is because it's
used after errors where a path is only partially enabled and it unwinds,
skipping the last item, because the last item didn't enable.

It seemed a bit more intrusive to change that, and it's already working.

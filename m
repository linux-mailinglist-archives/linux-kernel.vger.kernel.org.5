There is no umask in the uncore spec. Please see P120 of the spec.
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/download/intel-xeon-processor-e5-2600-v2-product-family-uncore-performance-monitoring-reference.html

It should be occ_sel.
The occ_sel = (the umask from the event list >> 6) & 0x3.

I don't think we want to change either the kernel or the perf tool.
There is nothing to help either if we add the occ_sel in the original
event list. So it seems the only choice should be handling it in the
convertor tool.

Is it possible to check the UNC_P_POWER_STATE_OCCUPANCY.CORES_C0 in IVT
and use "Filter": "occ_sel=0x1" to replace "UMask": "0x40"?

It seems everything in the filter will directly be appended. Is my
understanding correct?

Thanks,
Kan

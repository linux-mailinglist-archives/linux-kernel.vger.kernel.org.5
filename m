I am not sure what you are asking.

For some transfer modes, re-tuning is expected to deal with sampling
point drift over time, mainly due to temperature changes.  It is done
either periodically (tuning timer) or after a CRC error.

There is no reason to assume RPMB is immune from that.

Certainly re-tuning before switching to RPMB is not optimal for
performance, and we can leave that out, but a CRC error before
or during RPMB operations will *still* result in re-tuning
after switching back from RPMB.

In your case, re-tuning makes things worse, which is a bit of a
mystery.  Running the new re-tuning test would tell us whether
it makes things worse in general, or only for RPMB.

Other options are to boot with an initrd only, or after boot switch
to a RAM-based file system.

I was waiting for this, since it is good to try to get closer to a
root cause, but as you point out, the change is good for performance
also, so I will Ack it.

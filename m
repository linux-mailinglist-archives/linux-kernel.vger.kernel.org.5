Maybe you meant
+                       if (!pci_device_is_present(pdev) ||
+                               ite_sid != pci_dev_id(pci_physfn(pdev)))

Unfortunately, the ite_sid we got from the "Invalidation Queue Error Record Register" is the *PCI Requester-id* of faulty device, that could be different
BDF as the sid in the ATS invalidation request for devices:

1. behind the PCIe to PCI bridges.
2. behindConventional PCI Bridges  
3.PCI Express* Devices Using Phantom Functions  
4.Intel® Scalable I/O Virtualization Capable Devices  (e.g. ADI)
5. devices with ARI function.
6. behind root port without ACS enabled.
.. ...

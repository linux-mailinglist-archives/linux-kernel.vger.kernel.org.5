If I may suggest something, I would call this "pmdomain" instead of
"genpd".  I don't think that /drivers/power/ is a particularly
suitable location for it, because it doesn't really have much to do
with power supplies and more to do with device PM.

Also, I would move drivers/base/power/domain.c to drivers/pmdomain/
(and rename it to something like core.c), because it would be a better
location for that fiile IMO.

I can also handle future pull requests for this if that's fine with everyone.

Cheers!

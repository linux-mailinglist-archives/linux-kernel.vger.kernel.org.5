I remember (from the debugging session I've run few weeks ago) that I
checked on G1H an Ethernet register before point [1] and after point [3]
and the values were the same (but I may be wrong, I need to double check it).

I will double check also the value of MSTOP for Ethernet on RZ/G3S (though
I checked that this worked on my code), maybe RZ/G3S doesn't go to standby,
I have a bug in my code and that's why it works for RZ/G3S...

Also, I see that the STANDBY state is missing from CCC.OPC documentation
(chapter "37A.3.1 AVB-DMAC Operating Modes" on RZ/G1H vs "31.5.1 DMAC
Operating Modes" on RZ/G3S).

Ok, I found that one in my G1H manual. It is not available on RZ/G3S
manual, though.

This should work, though I would go with a pm_runtime_put_noidle().

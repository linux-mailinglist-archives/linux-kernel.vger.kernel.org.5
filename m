A reset should disable PTM.  I wonder if dock firmware could be
enabling PTM?  That would seem like a defect to me, because the dock
can't know whether the Downstream Port in the laptop has PTM enabled.

That's ... weird.  So something other than the OS enables PTM?  Not
sure how we can deal with that.  Some (probably most) laptop Root
Ports don't support PTM at all, so plugging the dock into one of those
would always cause errors.

We might need to disable AER in certain cases where errors are
unavoidable, like a surprise unplug that causes data link errors when
the plug gets yanked out.

But this PTM thing is not like that -- this is a configuration error,
and I think we should fix the configuration instead of ignoring the
error.

I'm a little confused about how this workaround works.  The subject
says "ignore AER reset", but here you say *avoid* resetting the
device.

I think we only reset things in the AER_FATAL case, and the PTM UR is
an AER_NONFATAL error, so I'm not sure what the effect of this patch
is.

Also, igc_io_error_detected() needs to return one of the
pci_ers_result values, not zero.  Zero isn't a valid return value, so
we can't rely on how pcie_do_recovery() handles it.

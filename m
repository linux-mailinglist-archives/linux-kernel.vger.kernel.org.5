Johan, Mani,
I am developing a PCIe driver which will not have the start_link
callback defined. Instead, the link will be coming up much later based
on some other trigger. So my driver will not attempt the LTSSM training
on probe. So even if the probe is made asynchronous, it will still end
up wasting 1 second of time.

I agree that my commit created regression in some of the existing SOCs.
I should not have taken the liberty to return an error if the
wait-for-link-up call fails in the probe.
But my commit's message body clearly mentions the motivation behind
calling dw_pcie_wait_for_link() only if the start_link is defined. Can
you please re-evaluate the decision to revert my patch and pick up the
suggested fix instead?

Thanks
Ajay

Interesting, I didn't know that about SUSE's usage pattern. That
would pretty much require that the SBAT enforcement is configured
per MokList entry, to retain sufficient flexibility for users.

I don't know what shim maintainers are planning, this was just an
idea I came up with when thinking through how to enforce SBAT without
making it a pain for users.

Agreed, I think it needs some feedback from the shim maintainers about
a vision for future SBAT enforcement. I'll raise this idea and see
what they say. If we eliminate the need for upstream linux to care
about SBTA that probably makes life easier for everyone.

With regards,
Daniel

These are simple fixes for simple bugs.

Do you always have to ask specifically or can I just mention it in the
pull request in the future?

Sounds good. If you want me to do something different, please let me
know.

Done.

nolibc limits itself intentionally to C89 language level which disallows
C++ style headers.

This should be covered by Documentation/process/license-rules.rst:

  If a specific tool cannot handle the standard comment style, then the
  appropriate comment mechanism which the tool accepts shall be used.


With that said:

Please pull the changes since the v6.6-rc1 tag from
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/nolibc/linux-nolibc.git/

The branch 'fixes' up to and including
921992229b1f06df6b649860e4a5f3def1489866 for the v6.6 cycle.

The branch 'next' up to and including
b8c60e8fc6f755c2cdf7164931afdbfa670c6646 for linux-next.

No full test has been performed as only a commit message was changed.

Testing for full nolibc stack:
make run:             162 test(s): 162 passed,   0 skipped,   0 failed => status: success
make run-nolibc-test: 162 test(s): 160 passed,   2 skipped,   0 failed => status: warning

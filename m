Actually what specifies an active cooling device is it requires energy 
in order to operate. More precisely, the goal of an active cooling 
device is too move the heat from one place to another place. So the 
system, instead of relying on the natural convection thermal transfer, 
will force this transfer. So the "active" means external system + energy.

Yes, absolutely :) And that is why I think we should clarify that to 
conform to the general semantic of the thermal management. If we define 
things in the thermal framework but having a different meaning in the 
thermal management vocabulary. That will be really odd and look amateur 
work :)

In the lower spectrum, an external warming device where we use energy to 
provide some heat is active. But if we use some kind of software 
solution (like what suggested before), we indeed use energy, but the 
solution is internal to the system, so I do believe we can consider it 
as passive.

IMO, we should see, especially on mobile, passive trip point for too 
hot, and active trip point for too cold. That would not surprising as 
the former has too much energy generated and the latter not enough energy.

(BTW, as a side note, active or passive trip points do not really make 
sense to me. It is the mitigation devices which are active or passive).

For the systems which do not have a dedicated warming up hardware, we 
should implement a "warming device" as a passive one (which is a 
different story from your proposal I agree).

Yes, and the more I think about it, the more I'm inclined to have:

  * trip (active|passive) + hot|cold
  * trip cold (meaning "really too cold")
  * trip hot (meaning "really too hot")
  * trip critical (meaning "I'm about to collapse")

We may have also active devices with multiple level of warm up, so it 
will need to be managed by a governor like the step wise.

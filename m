I was trying to avoid a big patch ~150 lines. I will do that merge.

Yes, I can add that to the description.

True, I will rephrase that, to make it more precised.

I have explained that in some previous patch response. A driver or
kernel module which monitors the thermal situation and has context.

Yes, it allocated new table and put the updated power values there.
I can add that to the comment.

It's done above, next to '!dev || !dev->em_pd'

So how to make sure that there is no 2 callers trying to update the
same EM or unregistration is not in the background?

That's why there is this 'synchronize_rcu()' above and the mutex. The
updating caller if finished the update, would unlock the mutex and this
unregister code can go. Here we call the synchronize_rcu() so we assure
the callback has finished for the update path and than we explicitly
free the saved 'runtime_table' here. So all data should be freed and
code serialized in those two paths.

I disagree and would say that any storage device sold as "industrial" should
guarantee power-fail safety. Plus, you mentioned data loss isn't even your concern,
but the storage device fails/bricks.

And also just practically, ensuring a safe power down could be in the order
of a second, so it would be quite a capacitor.

You don't need the RST signal, in fact even if you had it it would be
the wrong thing to do. (Implementation is vendor-specific but RST
assumes that eMMCs' VCC and VCCQ are left untouched.)
You can try turning off eMMC cache completely and/or sending power down
notification on 'emergency shutdown', but since power-loss/fail behavior
is vendor-specific asking the storage device vendor how to ensure a safe
power-down.
Anyway the proper eMMC power-down methods are up to a second in timeouts,
so infeasible for your requirements from what I can see.

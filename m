Yes, I need them defined here, definitely.

The same thing that happened to that card "model" error that shouldn't have
been there because I catched it before sending and fixed, then...

..I have ultimately sent the wrong changeset. My bad.

Anyway - since that's a bigger series, I'll wait for a few days and will
send the v3 with the names added to the audio-routing and this mentioned
in the commit description (so, that's happening next week).

Thanks for explaining.

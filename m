You are right. I should not have returned an error from the
dw_pcie_wait_for_link check. Raised v5 with the error return removed:

Mani, the intention is not to fix the intel-gw driver in any manner. It
calls dw_pcie_wait_for_link explicitly in the probe path and checks for
the error as well. So it has to live with the delay and the probe
failure if the link does not come up.

My intention is just to get rid of the 1 sec delay for the drivers that
do not define the start_link callback, and hence do not expect that the
link will come up during probe anyway.

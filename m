I mentioned this in earlier email. I think this means no SGX EPC. It does  
not mean sgx epc cgroup not enabled. That's also consistent with the  
behavior try_charge() fails if capacity is zero.

Echo "-misc" to cgroup.subtree_control at root level for example still  
shows non-zero sgx_epc capacity.

Unless I hear otherwise, I'll revert to BUG_ON().

Not sure if I have understood properly you request, but the type of extensions
present in a PBX/MBX block can be discovered at runtime together with their
characteristics (like the number of channels) so the specific DT properties
can be searched (or NOT) based on the features discovered at run-time:
are you asking for subnodes as a means of adding clarity to what can be
defined in a block depending on what it is (PBX vs MBX) and what
extensions it has ?

if that is the reason ... the convoluted names like pbx/mbx-dbch- etc...
was my attempt at thhat :D ... to give a hint at what you can define in a PBX
vs MBX block and what is related to each extensions...

Note that, though, since the PBX/MBX blocks are discoverable at runtime as such,
they are not identified as such in the DT (same compatible) so I would not have
anywayy the capability to check in the DT which is which (PBX/MBX) and if the
properties are appropriate or not, nor I could know which extensions are really
implemented, so such subnodes would ony be a way of grouping props in the DT
without adding any compile time check capability nor adding any improvement to
the runtime DT parsing proces...

..BUT, of course, I could be wrong and missing a something here, so I
am happy to corrected on the subnodes utility...

I'll do.

Thanks for the review.

Sounds nice!
All of this lives in <linux/pm_domain.h> (with underscore?) anyway,
and "PM Domains" is the usual naming, as it covers both Power and
Clock Domains.

However, although I am quite familiar with genpd, I am still wondering
what is the meaning of the "generic" part in the name? And what is a
non-generic PM Domain?

Which brings me to the final question: what is the upstream path
for changes to drivers/genpd/*/ (or whatever it's gonna be called)?
Before, we sent PRs to (arm-)soc.  Do you expect us to send them to
you? There's usually quite some interaction between drivers/soc/reneas/
and drivers/genpd/renesas (and there are DT binding definitions),
but not more than with e.g. drivers/clk/renesas/.

And I just realized you moved the code and Makefiles to drivers/genpd/,
but not the Kconfig symbols and logic, which still lives under
drivers/soc/.  So resolving that (and the name) is something that
should be resolved sooner rather than later...

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

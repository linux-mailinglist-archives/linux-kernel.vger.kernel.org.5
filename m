I think using the BIOS default as a limit is problematic.  I think it
would be perfectly reasonable for a BIOS to (a) configure only devices
it needs for console and boot, leaving others at power-on defaults,
and (b) configure devices in the safest configuration possible on the
assumption that an OS can decide the runtime policy itself.

Obviously I'm not a BIOS writer (though I sure wish I could talk to
some!), so maybe these are bad assumptions.

I suppose this means that the OEM image contains drivers that aren't
in the Microsoft media, and those drivers may set constraints on ASPM
usage?

If you boot the Microsoft media that lacks those drivers, maybe it
doesn't bother to configure ASPM for those devices?  Linux currently
configures ASPM for everything at enumeration-time, so we do it even
if there's no driver.

I'm still opposed to using dev_is_removable() as a predicate because I
don't think it has any technical connection to ASPM configuration.

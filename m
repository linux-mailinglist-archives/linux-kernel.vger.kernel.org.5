Well, in this case we actually want the controller to remain
unconfigured (e.g. to avoid having every user of the X13s unknowingly
use the same default address). 

I'm not sure why Qualcomm insists on breaking these quirks, but I guess
they just haven't understood why they exist. It's of course convenient
to be able to use the default address during development without first
having to provide an address, but that's not a valid reason to break the
driver.

From what I hear the Qualcomm developers only care about Android and I
believe they have some out-of-tree hack for retrieving the device
address directly from the rootfs.

For the X13s, and as I think I've mentioned before, we have been trying
to get Qualcomm to tell us how to access the assigned addresses that are
stored in some secure world storage so that we can set it directly from
the driver. But until we figure that out, users will need to continue
setting the address manually.

ok, you are right. Using "Microsoft" as the compatible string makes more 
sense. I will use that.

The original driver supports 2 ACPI CIDs, "VMGENCTR" and 
"VM_GEN_COUNTER" and as per this commit 
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0396e46dc46523cba8401a0df84f67cc0b6067ab 
"VMGENCTR" is to be used for VMGenID specs. So, I used "vmgenctr" to be 
consistent with its ACPI counterpart "VMGENCTR".

Ok, I will confirm my understanding and provide a better answer in my 
next mail. As you mentioned in another mail, I will also pause on 
posting any new version till the current threads are answered.

The driver does not assume any endianness. To provide more context, The 
hypervisor stores a 128bit unique ID at the address pointed by the 
"reg"'s 1st cell, driver memcpy's this ID to an internal context and 
uses memcmp to compare if the ID is new or old.
But yes, it will be good to define a fixed endianness to avoid any 
error. I will update the description to use little endian.

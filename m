Like Bjorn summarize it:
"We dodge the bullet as long as the mappings for BAR 0 are identical,
which doesn't feel like much comfort."

Yes, right now we don't have a cleanup of either the backing memory for
the BAR, or the iATUs mapping the PCI address to backing memory.
(We allocate the backing memory for the BARs in .bind(), and free it in
unbind().)

So the superfluous iATU6 mapping will be the same as the iATU0 mapping.

After your series, we will still allocate and free the backing memory
in .bind()/.unbind(), but we will set/clear the iATU mapping in the
init()/.deinit() EPF callbacks.

I think that we have spent too much time on this patch already.

My suggestion is that you simply apply it to pci/endpoint branch directly and
fixup the commit message (like Bjorn usually does with [bhelgaas: commit log])
after Frank's Sign-off.


Kind regards,
Niklas

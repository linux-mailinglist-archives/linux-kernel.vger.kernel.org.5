No, comments are not statements (in C).

You'd also never even consider interpreting it that way if you knew
where that exception comes from (namely that people break long
*statements* just to fit under 80 chars, thereby sometimes making the
*code* unnecessarily hard to read).

You got it backwards; you should only go *beyond* 80 chars if it
"significantly increases readability".

But again, this does NOT apply to comments in the first place.

Checkpatch is just a tool, not the standard, and knowing when it is ok
to break the 80 column rule for code requires human judgement.

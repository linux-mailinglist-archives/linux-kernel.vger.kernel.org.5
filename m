I don't understand what "| Interfaces |" means here.  There is, or is
not, a communication channel between the CoC guest VM and the Host VMM?

What does "interface" mean?

Same here, what does "Interfaces" mean?

And external attack vectors can't get to the kernel without going
through userspace (or the HW platform), right?

Ah, you define that here now.

But the kernel talks to the Bootloader/BIOS after things are up and
running all the time.

Same goes with the HW platform, the kernel talks to it too.

Ok, but again, your diagram is odd, the text seems correct though.

ok, good luck with that!  side-channel attack vectors are going to be
interesting for you to attempt to handle.

Anyway, you are setting yourself up to treat ALL data coming into any
kernel interface as potentially malicious, right?  I welcome the patches
to all of the drivers you are using to attempt to handle this properly,
and to cover the performance impact that it is going to cause (check all
the disk i/o packets!)  Good Luck!

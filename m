No doubt, but here only one commit message was included and it's hiding
information about the bug it introduced.

To recap:

- the CVE description comes from was upstream commit bed9e27baf52

- neither the CVE mitigation section nor the mentioned kernel releases
fix the bug mentioned in the upstream commit, because the mitigation
section also includes commits that _revert_ commit bed9e27baf52

- this second revert is not mentioned anywhere, so the CVE description
is at best misleading; or perhaps more accurately described as
"completely f***ed up".

I'm sure it's just a bug in the scripts, but it's worrisome that you
don't acknowledge this.

It doesn't have to be mandatory. Â But for people that _do_ want to do
the work, they might as well do it before the CVE is publicly announced,
rather than after. Â At least give us the possibility of doing it without
bureaucracy.

It is a use-after-free so, going by the recent announcements on
linux-cve-announce, it deserves a CVE.

I agree, but you're talking about commit references that were already
validated by a human. Â Something like this CVE, which says "the last
patch will fix the bug", or a variable rename with "no functional change
intended", certainly isn't a great CVE description.

They don't need massaged messages. Â They need correct and complete ones.
 Â  You're completely removing the human part of the work and expecting
the result to be of comparable quality. Â That's not going to happen, and
this CVE is an example of this.

All of them will read "The issue reverted commit fixing is fixed by last
patch in a new way" in the description and think what crap is this.

Some of them will see

 Â  Â  Â  Â  Issue introduced in 6.1 with commit 5e2cf333b7bd and fixed in 6.7.1
with commit 0de40f76d567
 Â  Â  Â  Â  Issue introduced in 6.1 with commit 5e2cf333b7bd and fixed in 6.7.2
with commit 87165c64fe1a

and will wonder which release actually fixes the bug.

A few of them will also notice that the suggested mitigation is to
absolutely do nothing, and will check if it's already April 1st.

This CVE is an order of magnitude worse than CVE-2024-0562 in terms of
confusion and wasted time for everyone involved.

They more often than not CC'd me before the patch was committed and
provided me the CVE id, and I was able to provide input or dispute the
assignment beforehand. Â This is exactly what I'm suggesting that the
kernel should do.

I don't recall anything like CVE-2024-0562 happening for KVM, but it's a
small subsystem.

So, looking at
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/security/vulns.git/tree/cve/review/6.7.proposed
I see

aeb686a98a9e usb: gadget: uvc: Allocate uvc_requests one at a time
da324ffce34c usb: gadget: uvc: Fix use-after-free for inflight usb_requests

What vulnerability is the first one fixing? Â Looking at your GSD
entries, will there even be CVEs purporting that renaming a variable
from "foo" to "bar" is fixing a vulnerability?

>> 3) are the scripts used to generate the CVEs public? Â Can fixes to the

>

What about the detection part?

I like to assume the best of people, so I'll assume that this is just
naÃ¯vetÃ© rather than an intentional attempt at burning everything down.
But please, let's take a step back and understand what the proposed
workflow fixes and breaks for everyone (especially maintainers and
distros). Â Then make a proper solution. Â In the meanwhile you can keep
sending test announcements to linux-cve-announce, and those can be used
to debug the process and the scripts.

In fact it would be nice if bippy included at the end the command line
that was used, to aid the reproduction and fixing of bugs.

Again: I'm optimistic that this process can be an improvement over what
various CNAs were doing before. Â But right now you're pushing out crap
that simply doesn't live up to the standards of how Linux operates, so
please stop.

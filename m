Hi Andrew,
I understand what you mean, and sorry for my wrong description. The link
is not always up. If I turn auto-neg off, the link will go down finally.
However, there is an intervel between my operation and the link down. In
my experiment, it may be 1 min or evn 10 mins. The phy state is set to
PHY_UP immediately when I set auto-neg off. And the phy machine check the
state during a very small intervals. Thus, during my experiment, the phy
state has a followed varietion:
PHY_RUNNING -> PHY_UP -> PHY_RUNNING -> PHY_NOLINK.

We print link up/down based on phy state and link state. In aboved case,
It print looks like:
eth0 link down -- because phy state is set to PHY_UP
eth0 link up -- because phy state is set to PHY_RUNNING
eth0 link down -- because link down

This patch wants to fix the first two wrong print.
We will modify this patch description

Thanks!

 Â  Jijie Shao

I also didn't like/understand that assumption, but again I don't have
enough familiarity with the code to judge, and I don't know why it was
done that way. Adding memcg and nid as arguments to the standard
list_lru API makes the pill easier to swallow. In any case, this
should be done in a separate patch to make the diff here more focused
on zswap changes.

On the other hand I am worried about the continuous growth of struct
zswap_entry. It's now at ~10 words on 64-bit? That's ~2% of the size
of the page getting compressed if I am not mistaken. So I am skeptical
about storing the nid there.

A middle ground would be allocating struct zswap_entry on the correct
node without charging it. We don't need to store the nid and we don't
need to charge struct zswap_entry. It doesn't get rid of
virt_to_page() though.

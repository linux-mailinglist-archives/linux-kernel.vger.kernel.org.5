If you look at device_add_attrs() in drivers/base/core.c, you'll notice
it calls device_add_groups() for the class, type and dev->groups.

pci_dev_attr_groups[] is assigned through the type.

What you want to do is amend pci_alloc_dev() to allocate enough space
for a struct attribute_group, in addition to struct pci_dev, then
assign it to dev->groups in that same function.  Define a macro
for the size.  Initially you'll need two struct attribute_group
elements, one for your DOE element plus one for the terminating
zero element.

If there are DOE mailboxes, let ->is_visible of the DOE group
return true and use "doe" as its ->name to make attributes appear
in a "doe" subdirectory.  Finally allocate and fill a struct
struct attribute[] array with all the protocols found in all the
mailboxes.

Thanks,

Lukas

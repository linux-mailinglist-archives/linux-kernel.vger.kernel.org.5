It's not necessary to do multiple TMFs in parallel, it's ok to make sure
each TMFs do not affect each other.

For example, we have two devices: 0:0:0:0 and 0:0:0:1

Both of them request device reset, they do not happened in parallel, but
would in serial. If 0:0:0:0 is performing device reset in progress, 0:0:0:1
just wait 0:0:0:0 to finish.

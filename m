Maybe add this already in the preceding patch.

I'd fold this change into the preceding patch.
Deleting a line introduced by the preceding patch isn't great.

Never mind that the patch isn't a clean revert that way.
Your approach of making changes to the original version
of the bandwith monitoring driver and calling out those
changes in the commit message seems fine to me.

It would be neater if you could avoid deleting lines introduced by
the preceding patch.  Ideally you'd add a new paragraph, thus only
add new lines but not delete any existing ones.

For extra neatness, drop the comma in the preceding patch and
the period in this patch.

Again, adding a new paragraph and not deleting lines introduced by
the preceding patch would be much nicer.

Which of these are necessary for functionality introduced by this
patch and which are necessary anyway and should be moved to the
preceding patch?

Code comment at the top of this file says "PCIe bandwidth controller",
use here as well for neatness.

Looks like this could be a u8 array to save a little bit of memory.

Also, this seems to duplicate pcie_link_speed[] defined in probe.c.

Hm, why is the compiler barrier needed?

Maybe move this to patch [06/10], i.e. set dev->bus->pcie_dev_speeds to
PCI_EXP_LNKCAP2_SLS_2_5GB on removal (instead of 0).

Can't we just do something like

	supported_speeds = bus->pcie_bus_speeds & dev_speeds;
	desired_speeds = GEN_MASK(pcie_link_speed[*speed], 1);
	*speed = BIT(fls(supported_speeds & desired_speeds));

and thus avoid the loop altogether?

So passing a higher speed than what's supported by the Endpoint is fine
but passing a higher speed than what's supported by the Downstream Port
is not?  Why the distinction?  Maybe it would be more logical to just
pick the maximum of what either supports and use that in lieu of a
too-high speed?

How about checking here if the selected speed is equivalent to what's
being used right now and bailing out if so?  No need to retrain if
we're already at the desired speed.

I think you should move that further up so that you allocate and populate
the data struct before requesting the IRQ.  Otherwise if BIOS has already
enabled link bandwith notification for some reason, the IRQ handler might
be invoked without the data struct being allocated.

Another trailing period I'd remove.

Absolutely, I am more than happy to include libclang.so and anything
else that would be useful for the kernel. Everything gets built but I
only install what has felt needed for the kernel, so there is no real
overhead aside from package size, which obviously should not increase
much with this change. I've added the targets to my build scripts and
kicked off a set of builds. If they finish successfully, I will upload
them so that you can test them out and make sure they will work.

Thanks for bringing this up and giving them a go, cheers!
Nathan

Ah, so IIUC what's happening is:

1) Userspace tries to detect extended type support, with a cycles event
   directed to one of the CPU PMUs. The attr for this does not have
   exclude_guest set.

2) In the kernel, the core perf code sees the extended hw type id, and directs
   this towards the correct PMU (apple_icestorm_pmu).

3) The PMU driver looks at the attr, sees exclude_guest is not set, and returns
   -EOPNOTSUPP, exactly as it would regardless of whether the extended hw type
   is used.

   Note: this happens to be a difference between x86 PMUs and the apple_* PMUs,
   but this is a legitimate part of the perf ABI, not an arm-specific quirk or
   bug.

4) Userspace receives -EOPNOTSUPP, and so decide the extended hw_type is not
   supported (even though the kernel does support the extended hw type id, and
   the event was rejected for orthogonal reasons).

5) Userspace avoids the extended hw type, but still uses
   PERF_EVENT_TYPE_HARDWARE events for named-pmu events.

Does that sound plausible to you, or have I misunderstood?

From Marc's reply at:

  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/86edggzfxx.wl-maz@kernel.org/

... with perf built from v6.4, the perf tool can open named pmu events without
issue, and sets exclude_guest in the attr. So it seems like there's a mismatch
between regular opening of events and probing for extended hw type that causes
that to differ.

AFAICT, the kernel is doing the right thing here, but the userspace detection
of extended type id support happens to differ from regular event opening, and
mis-interprets -EOPNOTSUP as "the kernel doesn't support extended type IDs"
rather than "The kernel was able to consume the extended type ID, but the
specific PMU targetted said it doesn't support this attr".

IIUC that means this'll be broken on older kernels (those before the extended
hw type id support was introduced), too?

It sounds like we need to make (4) more robust? I'm not immediately sure how, 
given the rats nest of returns in perf_event_open(), but I'm happy to try to
help with that.

It also seems like (5) is a problem regardless. If the user asks for a named
PMU event on an older kernel (before the extended hw type id was a thing), and
the tool converts that to a plain PERF_EVENT_TYPE_HARDWARE event, it's liable
to be handled by a different PMU than the one the user asked for.

Thanks,
Mark.

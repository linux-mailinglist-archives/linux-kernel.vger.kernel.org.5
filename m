As per cgroup-tools, please prove this. It makes the job for more
complicated *for you* and you are making the job more  complicated
to every possible person in the planet running any kernel QA.

I weight the latter more than the former. And it is exactly the
reason why we did custom user space kselftest in the first place.
Let's keep the tradition. All I can say is that kselftest is=20
unfinished in its current form.

What is "esp cgexec"?

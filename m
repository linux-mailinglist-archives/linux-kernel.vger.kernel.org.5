Yes, the issue is related to MSI-X. I will list down the exact set of function
calls below as well as the place where the completion timeout first occurs:
ks_pcie_probe
  dw_pcie_host_init
    pci_host_probe
      pci_bus_add_devices
        pci_bus_add_device
          device_attach
            __device_attach
              bus_for_each_drv
                __device_attach_driver (invoked using fn(drv, data))
                  driver_probe_device
                    __driver_probe_device
                      really_probe
                        pci_device_probe
                          pcie_portdrv_probe
                            pcie_port_device_register
                              pcie_init_service_irqs
                                pcie_port_enable_irq_vec
                                  pci_alloc_irq_vectors
                                    pci_alloc_irq_vectors_affinity
                                      __pci_enable_msix_range
                                        msix_capability_init
                                          msix_setup_interrupts
                                            msix_setup_msi_descs
                                              msix_prepare_msi_desc
In this function: msix_prepare_msi_desc, the following readl() causes completion
timeout:
		desc->pci.msix_ctrl = readl(addr + PCI_MSIX_ENTRY_VECTOR_CTRL);
The completion timeout with the readl is only observed when the link is down (No
Endpoint device is actually connected to the PCIe connector slot).

The symptoms of the above completion timeout show up as a 45 second delay during
boot if no Endpoint device is connected. This 45 second delay is due to the fact
that each readl() which normally takes 4 milliseconds (in presence of Endpoint
device) now take around 40 milliseconds due to waiting for completion. Also, if
I disable Completion Timeout in the PCIe controller, Linux hangs at the readl()
mentioned above. That is the very first readl() causing the completion timeout.

Yes, I am not fully sure myself why BAR0 being enabled is causing the issue. I
will debug further within the function ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus() to see which
section of it causes issues when the Link is down. What I am certain of however
is that exiting the ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus() function if Link is down fixes the
completion timeouts observed above with the readl(), thereby making the 45
second delay vanish during boot when no endpoint device is connected.

Please let me know in case of any suggestions to fix this issue.

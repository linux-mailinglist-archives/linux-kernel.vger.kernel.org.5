I was looking into UFS/NVMe user-space utils, it seems we may have to 
adapt rpmb frame data structure in optee-os to to handle NVMe/UFS
specific bits.

For nvme rpmb data frame, I think we would need an extra "target" member 
in rpmb data frame structure,
as NVMe can support upto 7 RPMB units, see  [1] "struct rpmb_data_frame_t"
UFS may support upto 3 or 4 RPMB regions.

So even if we use CID to uniquely identify RPMB device either from 
eMMC/NVMe/UFS, we still need identify which RPMB target/unit in case
if the device is NVMe, and which RPMB region if the device UFS.

Also both NVMe/UFS utils have two extra RPMB operations implemented,
Although new request/response operation than eMMC spec:
  1) Authenticated Device Configuration Block Write
  2) Authenticated Device Configuration Block Read

see [2] enum rpmb_request/response_type and [3]enum rpmb_op_type

do we need those implemented as well ?

Please let me know what you think about these.

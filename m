Ah, good point. Looking at the Linux driver code, that seems almost
mandatory, otherwise the PHY clock is not activated(?).
So that helped, I managed to SSH into my laptop, but it still hangs then.

Just for the sake of completeness, I also tried the other properties that
other boards use: As expected, motorcomm,keep-pll-enabled didn't help, as
the clock line just goes to the MAC pin, and is not used otherwise.
And also motorcomm,auto-sleep-disabled didn't improve stability. At least
not with the current settings, maybe it's needed later on.

The reset pin is hardwired via a simple RC circuit, so there is no GPIO,
and thus the delay parameters don't do anything, I suppose.

But as it's better now with the clk-out property, so I will definitely add
that.
Reports from others (Piotr) seem to suggest that Ethernet is working for
them, so I need to compare notes.

Thanks,
Andre

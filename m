Sorry, I don't think I explained myself very clearly. My issue was that
with your patch (and currently) we have the situation where
arch_swap_restore() can only restore a single page. But the function
takes a "struct folio *" argument.

Current mainline assumes that the folio is a single page, and with your
patch we now have a big comment explaining what's going on (bonus points
for that!) and pick out the correct page from the folio. What I'm
puzzled by is why the change was made in the first place to pass a
"struct folio *" - if we passed a "struct page *" that:

 a) It would be clear that the current API only allows a single page at
    a time.

 b) The correct page could be passed by the caller rather than
    arch_swap_restore() having to obtain the offset into the folio.

So if we choose option 1 then we're changing the API of
arch_swap_restore() to actually restore the entire folio and it makes
sense to pass a "struct folio *" - and I'm happy with that. But AFAICT
that's not what your patch currently implements as it appears to be
doing option 2.

I'm quite happy to believe that the overhead of option 2 is small and
that might be the right solution, but at the moment we've got an API
which implies arch_swap_restore() should be operating on an entire folio.

Note that I don't have any particularly strong views on this - I've not
been following the folio work very closely, but I personally find it
confusing when a function takes a "struct folio *" but then operates on
only one page of it.

So, it'd be best if there's no migration involved at all as per the
discussion with Maarten.

Yeah, I wouldn't worry about hard allocation of GPU time. CPU RT control
does that but it's barely used.

So, if this is the case, it'd be better to clarify this. ie. if the summary is:

fd gets assigned to the user with a certain action at which point the fd
doesn't have significant resources attached to it and the fd can't be moved
to some other cgroup afterwards.

then, everything is pretty simple. No need to worry about migration at all.
fd just gets assigned once at the beginning and everything gets accounted
towards that afterwards.

I'd much prefer to straighten out this before adding a prelimiary stat only
thing. If the previously described ownership model is sufficient, none of
this is complicated, right? We can just add counters to track the resources
and print them out.

Thanks.

ISTR that I commented that filesystems like XFS can't implement
REQ_PROVISION semantics for extents without on-disk format
changes. Hence that needs to happen before we expose a new API to
userspace....

Yes, tracking provisioned ranges persistently and the reservations
they require needs on-disk filesytem format changes compared to just
preallocating space.  None of this functionality currently exists in
any filesystem that supports shared extents, and it's a fairly
significant chunk of development work to support it.

Nobody has planned to do this sort of complex surgery to XFS at
this point in time. I doubt that anyone on the btrfs side of
things is really even following this discussion because this is
largely for block device thinp and snapshot support
and btrfs just doesn't care about that.

Well, yes. This is the same situation as "for non-sparse block
devices, REQ_PROVISION can just be ignored." This is not an
interesting use case, nor a use case that the functionality or APIs
should be designed around.

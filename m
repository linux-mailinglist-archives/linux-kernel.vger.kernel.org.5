I removed that part of the previous patch because there's no point to 
it.  None of this code ever gets executed; the usb_dev->wusb test can 
never succeed because the kernel doesn't support wireless USB any more.  
(I asked Greg KH about that in a separate email thread: 
<https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/2a21cefa-99a7-497c-901f-3ea097361a80@rowland.harvard.edu/#r>.)

A later patch will remove all of the wireless USB stuff.  The only real 
reason for leaving this much of the code there now is to prevent 
compilation errors and keep the form looking right.

The descriptors_changed check has to be _somewhere_, either here or 
there.  I don't see what difference it makes whether the check is done 
in this routine or in hub_port_init.  Since it doesn't matter, why 
change the existing code?

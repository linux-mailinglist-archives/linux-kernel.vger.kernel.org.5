How?  You can do that with two VMAs, but this is limited to scanning
within a single VMA.  If we've COWed a large folio, we currently do
so as a single page folio, and I'm not seeing any demand to change that.
If we did COW as a large folio, we'd COW every page in that folio.
How do we interleave two large folios in the same VMA?

I agree that running that part of the test-suite would be useful, but
could you point to which test specifically would create a problem here?

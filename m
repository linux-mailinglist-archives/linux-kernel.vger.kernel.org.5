That's not quite right, in ext4_mb_choose_next_group_goal_fast() even
though we're looking for the group with order 13, the group with 32768
free blocks is also in there. So after passing ext4_mb_good_group() in
ext4_mb_find_good_group_avg_frag_lists(), we get a group with 32768
free blocks. And in ext4_mb_choose_next_group_best_avail() we were
supposed to allocate blocks quickly by trim order, so it's necessary
here too. So there are no unnecessary loops here.

But this will trigger the freshly added WARN_ON_ONCE, so in the
new iteration I need to change it to:

if (WARN_ON_ONCE(order > MB_NUM_ORDERS(ac->ac_sb) + 1))
         order = MB_NUM_ORDERS(ac->ac_sb) - 1;

In addition, when the block size is 4k, there are these limitations:

1) Limit the maximum size of the data allocation estimate to 8M in
     ext4_mb_normalize_request().
2) #define MAX_WRITEPAGES_EXTENT_LEN 2048
3) #define DIO_MAX_BLOCKS 4096
4) Metadata is generally not allocated in many blocks at a time

So it seems that only group_prealloc will allocate more than 2048
blocks at a time.

And I've tried removing those 8M/2048/4096 limits before, but the
performance of DIO write barely changed, and it doesn't look like
the performance bottleneck is here in the number of blocks allocated
at a time at the moment.

Thanks,
Baokun

I've rebased the core of that atop v6.6, and pushed that out to my
arm64/stacktrace/kunwind branch:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mark/linux.git/log/?h=arm64/stacktrace/kunwind

Once v6.7-rc1 is out, I'll rebase that and post it out (possibly with some of
the other patches atop).

With that I think you can implement arch_bpf_stack_walk() in stacktrace.c using
kunwind_stack_walk() in a similar way to how arch_stack_walk() is implemented
in that branch.

If BPF only needs a single consume_fn, that can probably be even simpler as you
won't need a struct to hold the consume_fn and cookie value.

Mark.

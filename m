If you read that function carefully, you wouldn't say "sleep" there....

that is 'sync'ed.

I don't know if the polling along sleeping for completion of meanningless

devTLB invalidation request blindly sent to (removed/powered down/link down)

device makes sense or not.

But according to PCIe spec  6.1  10.3.1

"Software ensures no invalidations are issued to a Function when its

  ATS capability is disabled. "

Could you point out why is not proper ? Is there any other window

the hard lockup still could happen with the ATS capable devcie

supprise_removal case if we checked the connection state first ?

Please help to elaberate it.

Yes, this is the old kernel stack trace, but customer also tried lasted 
6.7rc4

(doesn't work) and the patched 6.7rc4 (fixed).

No problem.  This was the easiest approach for me and I have now done this. 
Apologies for the delay in getting to this: I ran out of time last Thursday.

I can confirm that as expected, this patch series has had no effect on the
system which experiences the failed resource reallocation.  From syslog,
running a 5.15.141+ kernel[1]:

    kernel: radeon 0000:4b:00.0: Fatal error during GPU init
    kernel: radeon: probe of 0000:4b:00.0 failed with error -12

This is unchanged from what is seen with the unaltered 5.15.141 kernel.

In case it's important, can also confirm that the errors related to the
thunderbolt device are are also still present in the patched 5.15.141+
kernel:

    thunderbolt 0000:04:00.0: interrupt for TX ring 0 is already enabled
    :
    thunderbolt 0000:04:00.0: interrupt for RX ring 0 is already enabled
    :

Like the GPU failure, they do not appear in the working kernels on this
system.

Let me know if you would like to me to run further tests.

Regards
  jonathan

[1] This is 5.15.141, patched with the series of interest here and the hand
    patch from Ilpo.

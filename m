Yeah, I think all the drivers which need to be supported on RISC-V
ACPI based systems will have to support deferred probe with this scheme.

Yes, these are standard devices in the namespace. For ex: PNP0501(16550)
or PNP0C0F (PCI interrupt link devices) are in the namespace.

That's partly correct. APLIC platform devices are created prior to PCI
host bridges added. But the actual APLIC driver which creates the
irqdomain will be probed as a regular platform driver for the APLIC
device. The platform driver probe will happen using DD framework and
devices don't have any dependency on APLIC which can cause device probe
prior to APLIC driver probe.

DT supports fw_devlink framework which makes it easier for IRQ devices
to use regular platform drivers and produces-consumers are probed in the
order without requiring drivers to do deferred probe. But I don't see
that supported for ACPI framework.  Also, the way PNP devices get added
there is an assumption that interrupt controller is already setup fully.

With this new use case in RISC-V, here are the alternatives I am aware of.

1) Use core_initcall() in the APLIC drivers which makes APLIC driver to
be probed prior to PNP or PCI INTx devices. But this was ruled out in
the context of DT from Marc.

2) Like the approach tried in this series, add support for deferred
probe in drivers. This will be invasive change requiring many drivers to
change like you pointed.

I don't know which is less evil or if there is any other alternative
which I am not aware of.

Thomas/Marc, could you allow APLIC (and PLIC) irqchip drivers to use
core_initcall() for ACPI?

Thanks,
Sunil

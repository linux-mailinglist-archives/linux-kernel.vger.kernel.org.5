LGTM with a couple of nits below:

nit: The term "scheduled" here is deceptive imo, it makes me think of
queue_work() and friends, when it is directly called from
resume_user_mode_work(). Can we change the terminology to "called from
the userland return path" or directly reference
resume_user_mode_work() instead? Same applies to the added comment
below in try_charge_memcg().

nit: "when possible" is not entirely accurate, it makes it seem like
we call mem_cgroup_handle_over_high() whenever we can (which means
gfpflags_allow_blocking() imo). We actually choose not to call it in
some situations, and this patch is adding one such situation. So
perhaps "when possible and desirable" or just "when appropriate".

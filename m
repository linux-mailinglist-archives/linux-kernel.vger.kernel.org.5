Which model of the IGD you are using? even for the IGD in Atom D2550,
the legacy 128KB VGA memory range can be tuned to be mapped to IGD
or to the DMI Interface. See the 1.7.3.2 section of the N2000 datasheet[1].

If a specific model of Intel has a bug in the VGA routing hardware logic unit,
I would like to ignore it. Or switch to the UEFI firmware on such hardware.

It is the hardware engineer's responsibility, I will not worry about it.
Thanks for you tell this.

As you already said, the generous Intel already have confirmed that the hardware defect.
So probably this is a good chance to switch to UEFI to solve the problem. Then, no
testing for legacy is needed.

Thanks for you tell me this.

To be honest, I have only tested my patch on machines with UEFI firmware.
Since UEFI because the main stream, but if this patch is really useful for
majority machine, I'm satisfied. The results is not too bad.

Thanks.

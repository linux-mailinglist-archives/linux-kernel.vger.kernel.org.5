Okay. I think to fix this problem we should add refcnt relation between
memcg and stock, and since higher versions have achieved this, maybe
it's better to use the same code and align with them. So I put a "commit
xxx upstream" here, as requested in kernel docs[1]. So yes it's a
partial backport as we only need the stock part.

I think it's not a problem since refill_stock() has disabled irq before
calling drain_stock():

refill_stock(memcgC)
  local_irq_save
  drain_stock(memcgA)
    css_put(old->css)
    <1>
    stock->cached = NULL
  local_irq_restore
  <2>

And since css_put(old->css) is an RCU free, memcgA would not be freed at
<1> as it's still in grace period. The actual release of memcgA could
happen only after irq is enabled (at <2>).

And for CPU2, the access to stock->cached in drain_all_stock() is
protected by rcu_read_lock(), so from stock->cached we get either NULL,
or a memcgA that is still not freed.

Please correct me if I have some wrong understanding to RCU.

Sure, and neither am I.  (And frankly, I vastly prefer this reasoned
discussion to prior ones.)

Secure Launch technology really is used today as out-of-tree code, and
it has taken ~15y to get to this point of doing it nicely in an
ecosystem that is wider than just Linux.  (Not a criticism, just an
observation)

We're looking not to get blocked with a brand new objection which
approximates to "it's now not perfect, therefore you can't have
something that's still a lot better than nothing".

A major reason why the hardware ecosystem is out of date is because
almost no-one uses it, because it's horribly complicated to configure,
because it's a set of large out-of-tree patche series against your
bootloader, hypervisor and kernel.

The goal of the Trenchboot project is to make it easy to use (i.e.
upstream support in the relevant projects), so that more people can use
it, in order to drive the hardware ecosystem forward.

Very seriously - Linux taking this series, even off by default and with
a "SHA-1 considered hazardous for your health" warning somewhere, will
still have a material positive impact in getting the hardware ecosystem
to improve.  It is, by far and away, the best thing that we (Trenchboot)
can do in order to move towards a SHA-1-less future.

Trenchboot do have a specific intent to get to that future, and beyond,
but it's a multi-year task.

There are indeed collisions, and this will indeed get worse over time.

But right now it still takes nation-state (or certain corporation)
resources to calculate a collision, and that would have to be specific
to the exact firmware/settings/hypervisor/kernel/initrd configuration of
the target device.

Google et al invested the effort in SHAttered in order to drive change
in the industry, but that doesn't mean it's viable as a general attack
yet.  There are far more cost effective options, even a $4 wrench...

Oh both Intel and AMD, the base technology is around in all platforms
the support virt.

On Intel, it's SKU-limited to vPRO, but platforms with fTPM2.0 have been
generally SHA1+SHA256 capable for years now.  A security conscious end
user would just want to cap the SHA1 banks and run with SHA256.

Furthermore, when the attestation is based on a SHA1+SHA256 measurement,
the attestor can spot and reject SHA1 collisions, so this configuration
really should be safe to the concerns raised here.

On AMD, it's not SKU-limited.  However, their fTPM2.0 isn't SKINIT
compatible, and we were basically told "show us people using SKINIT
first".  I'm not sure if we've got as far as trying to an LPC TPM 2.0 on
AMD yet.  Even bus interception attacks can be defended against with TPM
encrypted sessions,  but we put this in the "not for v1" bucket.


It's not a secret - the intent of getting this technology more-generally
usable (and therefore used) is to be able to go back to Intel and say
"hey notice how AMD give this technology to everyone", and to say AMD
"hey notice how Intel have this working with TPM2".  Both have been
persuaded along this direction by Microsoft by virtue of including the
Pluton IP blob in the main CPU package.

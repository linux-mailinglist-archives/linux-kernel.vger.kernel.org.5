So it always bugged me that POSIX ACLs push umask stripping down into
the individual filesystems but it's hard to get rid of this. And we
tried to improve the situation during the POSIX ACL rework by
introducing vfs_prepare_umask().

Aside from that, the problem had been that filesystems like nfs v4
intentionally raised SB_POSIXACL to prevent umask stripping in the VFS.
IOW, for them SB_POSIXACL was equivalent to "don't apply any umask".

And afaict nfs v4 has it's own thing going on how and where umasks are
applied. However, since we now have the following commit in vfs.misc:

commit f61b9bb3f8386a5e59b49bf1310f5b34f47bcef9

    fs: add a new SB_I_NOUMASK flag

    SB_POSIXACL must be set when a filesystem supports POSIX ACLs, but NFSv4
    also sets this flag to prevent the VFS from applying the umask on
    newly-created files. NFSv4 doesn't support POSIX ACLs however, which
    causes confusion when other subsystems try to test for them.

    Add a new SB_I_NOUMASK flag that allows filesystems to opt-in to umask
    stripping without advertising support for POSIX ACLs. Set the new flag
    on NFSv4 instead of SB_POSIXACL.

    Also, move mode_strip_umask to namei.h and convert init_mknod and
    init_mkdir to use it.

I think it's possible to pick up the first patch linked above:
   
fix umask on NFS with CONFIG_FS_POSIX_ACL=n doesn't lead to any

and see whether we see any regressions from this.

The second patch I can't easily judge that should go through nfs if at
all.

So proposal/question: should we take the first patch into vfs.misc?

Yes, exactly. The rootport does NOT generate interrupt when the couter overflows.
I think the assumption hidden in this design is 64-bit counter will not overflow
within observable time.

PCIe 5.0 slots can now reach anywhere between ~4GB/sec for a x1 slot up to ~64GB/sec
for a x16 slot. The unit of counter is 16 byte.

	2^64/(64/16*10^9)/60/60/24/365=146 years

so, the counter will not overflow within 146 years.

Yes. The rootport is based on DesignWare IP and this PMU driver is expected
to work for any device based on the same IP.

Unfortunately, due to the limition of current IP design, we have to follow
the databook and only support Alibaba device now. If a non-Alibaba device is
added, this driver can support it with minimal modifications.

Fine, I will change it.

I will remove the ARM64 dependency and add COMPILE_TEST.

The server chips, named Yitian 710, are custom-built by Alibaba Group's chip
development business, T-Head.

	  Enable perf support for Synopsys DesignWare PCIe PMU Performance
	  monitoring event on platform including the Alibaba Yitian 710.

Is this okay?

My topo. Will fix it.

I see, will replace the last tab with some space to avoid across 80 column.

Agreed, will move list_del() after perf_pmu_unregister().

Yes, RAS DES Capability is defined in Vendor-Specific Extended Capability.

Quite agree.

A more general approach would be to define the RAS DES capability in the
Designated Vendor-Specific Capability. This way, all devices based on the
same IP could identify DES by using pci_find_dvsec_capability() with
PCI_VENDOR_ID_SYNOPSYS, independent of the vendor ID of a given device.
By implementing this approach, the PMU driver will be able to support the
devices without any modifications needed.


Thank you for valuable comments.

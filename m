Thanks for the analysis, Wei!

I will update the patch series based on your ideas to limit the
contention on the userspace read mutex.

It will only be a fallback if there is high concurrency among
userspace reads, which will cause high contention on the mutex. In
that case, the userspace reads will be slowed down by contention,
which can be even worse than flush slowness as it is theoretically
unbounded.

I am working on a v5 now to incorporate Wei's suggestions. Would you
be able to test that and verify that there are no regressions?

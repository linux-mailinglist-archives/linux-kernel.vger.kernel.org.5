It depends upon what the PHY drivers and underlying hardware are capable 
and willing to do. Some PHY drivers will shutdown the TX path completely 
since you do not need that part to receive Wake-on-LAN packets and pass 
them up to the PHY and/or MAC Wake-on-LAN matching logic. This would 
invite us to let individual PHY drivers make a decision as to what they 
want to do in a .shutdown() routine that would then need to be added to 
each and every driver that wants to do something special. In the absence 
of said routine, you could default to calling phy_disable_interrupts() 
unless the PHY has WoL enabled?

phydev::wol_enabled reflects whether the PHY and/or the MAC has 
Wake-on-LAN enabled which could you could key off to "nullify" what the 
shutdown does.

There is also the case of the boot loader not touching any 
PHY/MAC/networking and just booting as fast as possible to the kernel. 
It really becomes a problem that can be distributed against multiple SW 
agents to solve it, though clearly the kernel could do it too, so why 
not keep it there I guess.

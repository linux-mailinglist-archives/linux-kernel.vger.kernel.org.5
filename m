The PCISIG published the DOE r1.1 ECN in September 2022.

It replaced all occurrences of the term "protocol" with either "feature"
or "data object type".  Please adhere to the terms used by the spec so
that it is easy for an uninitiated reader to make the connection between
the spec and the implementation.

DOE r1.1 was merged into the PCIe Base Spec r6.1.  It wasn't merged into
r6.0.1 yet.

I kind of like the approach of exposing a list which can be grep'ed,
even though it may go against the rule of having just one datum per
attribute.  I'd prefer a representation that's human-readable though,
e.g. "0001:01" for CMA-SPDM.

For all practical purposes, the maximum size which can be returned
by a sysfs attribute (PAGE_SIZE, i.e. 4 kByte on x86) ought to be
sufficient.  I'd say a mailbox typically doesn't support more than,
say, 10 protocols.

Right, just expose raw numbers and let lspci print them in beautified
(parsed) form.

Since you intend to expose an interface for interacting with mailboxes,
on top of just exposing a list of supported data types (protocols),
I think you should first come up with a plan how to do that instead
of kicking the can down the road.  The sysfs ABI is sort of set in
stone, you can't easily change it if you realize after the fact
that it has deficiencies for your use case.

sysfs is not suitable for interaction with DOE mailboxes because the
filesystem imposes a size restriction of PAGE_SIZE per read.  DOE
allows up to 1 MByte per request or response, so way bigger than the
puny 4 kByte PAGE_SIZE on x86.  Splitting response reception into
multiple reads of the same attribute would be an awful kludge.
So I think you need to resort to devfs or procfs for mailbox interaction,
instead of sysfs.

Question is, if you use devfs/procfs for mailbox interaction, maybe it
makes sense to expose the list of supported data types there as well,
instead of in sysfs?

If you do expose a list of supported protocols, you should definitely
have one sysfs attribute per mailbox, e.g. "doe_123" or "doe@123" if
the mailbox is located at offset 123 in config space.

I envision that we'll provide a higher-level ABI for things like
measurement retrieval, either through IMA or maybe sysfs, but not
low-level access to the SPDM session.

In fact, I think if you do implement mailbox interaction, you may
want to blacklist certain data types that are handled in-kernel,
such as CMA-SPDM.

And you should constrain the whole thing to
!security_locked_down(LOCKDOWN_PCI_ACCESS).

FWIW, an experimental in-kernel implementation of SPDM measurement
retrieval already exists (it goes on top of my doe branch that I
linked to previously):

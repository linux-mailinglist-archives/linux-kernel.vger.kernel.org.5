Ah sorry, my wording was not good here, I meant on the line I was=20
changing in the patch and that line didn't exist in 680e9c47a229 at all.=20

So yes, DLLLA and use_lt waiting was added in 680e9c47a229 but the merge=20
commit brought the implementation note related code into=20
pcie_retrain_link() which I think was mismerged when it comes to use_lt.

In pcie_retrain_link(), there are two calls into=20
pcie_wait_for_link_status() and the second one of them is meant to=20
implement the link-has-been-established check.

The first wait call comes from e7e39756363a ("PCI/ASPM: Avoid link=20
retraining race") and is just to ensure the link is not ongoing retraining=
=20
to make sure the latest configuration in captured as required by the=20
implementation note. LT being cleared is exactly what is wanted for that=20
check because it means that any earlier retraining has ended (a new one=20
might be starting but that doesn't matter, we saw it cleared so the new=20
configuration should be in effect for that instance of link retraining).

So my point is, the first check is not even meant to check that link has=20
been established.

>  What are you trying to achieve here and what problem is it to fix?

Actually, I misthought what it breaks so the problem is not well described=
=20
above but I still think it is broken:

In the case of quirk, before 2.5GT/s is attempted DLLLA is not set,=20
right? Then quirk sets 2.5GT/s target speed and calls into=20
pcie_retrain_link().

The first call into pcie_wait_for_link_status() is made with (..., false,=
=20
true) which waits until DLLLA is set but this occurs before OS even=20
triggered Link Retraining. Since there's no retraining commanded by the=20
OS, DLLLA will not get set, the wait will fail and error is returned, and=
=20
the quirk too returns failure.

It could of course occur that because of the HW retraining loop=20
(independent of OS control), the link retrains itselfs to 2.5GT/s without=
=20
OS asking for it just by OS setting the target speed alone, which is well=
=20
possible given the HW behavior in your target speed quirk case is not=20
fully understood. Even if that's the case, it seems not good to rely on=20
the HW originating retraining loop triggering the link retraining that
is necessary here.

Maybe this is far fetched thought but perhaps it could explain why you=20
didn't get the link up with your setup when you tried to test it earlier.

Alternative approach to fix this problem would be to not make the first=20
call into pcie_wait_for_link_status() at all when use_lt =3D false.

Of course, I cannot test this with your configuration so I cannot=20
confirm how the target speed quirk behaves, I just found it by reading the=
=20
code. The current code does not make sense because the first wait is=20
supposed to wait for LT bit, not for DLLLA.

Yeah, this makes easy to use the seq-number as index.

But in that case, the entry number may not be enough for storing all object.
(or limit the number of objects)

Actually, since the rethook needs to make a shadow stack list per task not
per cpu, the (safe) required number of object is usually proportional to the
number of active tasks. kretprobes sets the default number of nodes according
to the CPUs but it is minimum requirement. This is because, 
- most of the kernel functions are not nested, thus it is called once on each
 thread in the kernel.
- the thread can be scheduled or slept, thus the function return hook also is
  not done until the thread comes back.
So, usually, the recommended number of node (obj) will be 100-200 (depends on
the system.) If it is a server, it may be more than 1000.

Hmm, at this moment, I don't recommend you to stick on the cache line but
easier to read. If you have any number, you can add optimize patch afterwards.
But the initial patch should take care about the readability.

Unless you pack the data structure, you don't need to care about
the cache. And the compiler works better than human for initial work.
At this moment, it is more important to reduce the members as simple
as possible.

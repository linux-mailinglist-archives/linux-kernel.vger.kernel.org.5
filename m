Understood; that's very useful information for the Android context. Multiple
people have made comments about eventually needing khugepaged (or something
similar) support in the server context though to async collapse to contpte size.
Actually one suggestion was a user space daemon that scans and collapses with
MADV_COLLAPSE. I suspect the key will be to ensure whatever solution we go for
is flexible and can be enabled/disabled/configured for the different environments.

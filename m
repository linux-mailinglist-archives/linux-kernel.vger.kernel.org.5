Can you cc me when posting that rework?

I'm not sure I understood this properly. What is "base address" in this
context? Is for swiotlb "base address" basically the return value
of swiotlb_tbl_map_single() -- I referred to this as tlb_addr previously?

If yes, I understand that  satisfying 1 means satisfying 
tlb_addr & combined_mask == 0, where combined_mask describes the
combined alignment requirement (i.e. combined_mask == min_align_mask |
alloc_align_mask | (alloc_size < PAGE_SIZE ? 0 : (PAGE_SIZE-1)). Does
that sound about right?

Can we assume that if 1. then the start address of the mapping
that is orig_addr needs to be already aligned?

Assumed I understood 1 correctly, I think we are missing something.

4. preserve the n (0 <= n <= 31) lowest bits of all addresses within the
mapping.

Was it just 1, 2 and 3 then we wouldn't need the whole offsetting
business introduced by commit 1f221a0d0dbf ("swiotlb: respect
min_align_mask"). Let me cite from its commit message:

"""
    Respect the min_align_mask in struct device_dma_parameters in swiotlb.
    
    There are two parts to it:
     1) for the lower bits of the alignment inside the io tlb slot, just
        extent the size of the allocation and leave the start of the slot
         empty
     2) for the high bits ensure we find a slot that matches the high bits
        of the alignment to avoid wasting too much memory
    
    Based on an earlier patch from Jianxiong Gao <jxgao@google.com>.
"""

Do we agree, that 4. needs to be added to the list? Or was it supposed
to be covered by 1.?

AFAIU 4. is about either (tlb_addr & combined_mask) == (orig_addr &
combined_mask) or about (tlb_addr & min_aling_mask) == (orig_addr &
min_align_mask). And I would like to know which of the two options it is.

Cc-ing Jianxiong.

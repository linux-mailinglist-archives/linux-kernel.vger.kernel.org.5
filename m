FWIW I went and re-read the internal review I provided on May 18.
Turns out I already mentioned back then that gaps aren't permitted:

 "Per PCIe r6.0.1 sec 8.2.1, the bitfield in the Link Capabilities 2
  register is not permitted to contain gaps between maximum supported
  speed and lowest possible speed (2.5 GT/s Gen1)."


> Also, I note that pci_set_bus_speed() doesn't use LNKCAP2.

About that, I wrote in May:

 "Actually, scratch that.  pci_set_bus_speed() is fine.  Since it's only
  interested in the *maximum* link speed, reading just LnkCap is correct.
  LnkCap2 only needs to be read to determine if a certain speed is
  *supported*.  E.g., even though 32 GT/s are supported, perhaps 16 GT/s
  are not.

  It's rather pcie_get_speed_cap() which should be changed.  There's
  no need for it to read LnkCap2.  The commit which introduced this,
  6cf57be0f78e, was misguided and had to be fixed up with f1f90e254e46.
  It could be simplified to just read LnkCap and return
  pcie_link_speed[linkcap & PCI_EXP_LNKCAP_SLS].  If the device is a
  Root Port or Downstream Port, it doesn't even have to do that but
  could return the cached value in subordinate->max_bus_speed.
  If you add another attribute to struct pci_bus for the downstream
  device's maximum speed, the maximum speed for Endpoints and Upstream
  Ports could be returned directly as well from that attribute."

Thanks,

Lukas

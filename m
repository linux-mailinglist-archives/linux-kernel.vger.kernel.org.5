For the most part, I have been hooking up software endpoint models to hardware design components speaking the PCIe transaction layer protocol. The central piece you need is a way to translate between the VFIO-user protocol and PCIe transaction layer messages, basically converting ECAM accesses, memory accesses (DMA+MMIO), and interrupts between the two worlds. I have some code which implements the basics of that. It's certainly far from complete (TLP is a massive protocol), but it works well enough for me. I believe we should be able to open-source this if there's interest, let me know.

The project is promising.

I found a session about the vfio adapts to Multi-process QEMU[1] in KVM 
Forun 2021, butI couldn't found some posted patches.
If anyone knows status of this project, could you please let me know?

I agree.
>>> One thing to note is that there are currently some limits to bridging VFIO-user / TLP that I haven't figured out and/or will need further work: Advanced PCIe concepts like PASID, ATS/PRI, SR-IOV etc. may lack equivalents on the VFIO-user side that would have to be filled in. The folk behind libvfio-user[2] have been very approachable and open to improvements in my experience though.

>>> If I understand correctly, the specific goal here is testing PCIe endpoint designs against a Linux host. What you'd need for that is a PCI host controller for the Linux side to talk to and then hooking up endpoints on the transaction layer. QEMU can simulate host controllers that work with existing Linux drivers just fine. Then you can put a vfio-user-pci stub device (I don't think this has landed in qemu yet, but you can find the code at [1]) on the simulated PCI bus which will expose any software interactions with the endpoint as VFIO-user protocol messages over unix domain socket. The piece you need to bring is a VFIO-user server that handles these messages. Its task is basically translating between VFIO-user and TLP and then injecting TLP into your hardware design.

Sorry, I misunderstood.

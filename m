Thank you for your comment.

To my understanding, the roadtest uses UML and it interact with hardware 
model written in python to do testing. This would be grate for automated 
testing to test drivers and subsystems.

For this PCIe endpoint, I think we need to hosts, one that works as a 
PCIe endpoint and one that is a PCIe Root Complex to it. Is it possible 
to realize the system?
like:
UML + PCIe endpoint function driver <-> python HW model (PCI Endpoint 
controller) <-> UML + pci driver for the function


As another option, I'm considering the feasibility of dummy PCIe EPC 
driver. It works as a PCIe EPC device in kernel and show pci device 
according to the PCIe endpoint function driver to the same host. so It 
could be realize a single host and test the function driver.


Best,

Shunsuke

What you say does make sense - and a lot - but still, I think that freeing
a NULL VA (= freeing nothing) is something that shouldn't happen...

... because if you notice, some of the calls to mtk_vcodec_mem_free() are not
checked with `if (something->va)` beforehand, so I think that those are cases
in which freeing with a NULL VA would actually be an indication of something
going wrong and/or not as expected anyway (checking beforehand = error won't
get printed from mtk_vcodec_mem_free(), not checking = print error if va==NULL)

It's an easy check:
cd drivers/media/platform/mediatek/vcodec
grep -rb1 mtk_vcodec_mem_free

P.S.: h264_if, av1_req_lat :-)

That's why I think that you should drop your [4/4] - unless MediaTek comes in
stating that the missed checks are something unintended, and that every instance
of VA==NULL should print an error.

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they did so, because anyway this occurs only
in two decoders...

Regards,
Angelo

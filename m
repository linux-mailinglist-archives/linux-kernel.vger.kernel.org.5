Yes, this is clear. You simply get _some_ snapshot of the past.

Yes, but the amount of waiting is also undeterministic and even after
you waited your stats might be outdated already depending on how quickly
somebody allocates. That was my point.

Flushing would be mostly unnecessary as somebody has just flushed
everything. The only point of mutex is to remove the super ugly busy
wait for sleepable context construct.

That difference is 3MB of memory. What is the precision you are
operating on?

To be honest, this would be my preferable option because of 2 reasons.
a) we do not want to guarantee to much on the precision front because
that would just makes maintainability much more harder with different
people having a different opinion of how much precision is enough and b)
it makes the more rare (need precise) case the special case rather than
the default.

That doesn't really matter because from the userspace POV it is really
not important how the whole thing is implemented and whether the
interface blocks in reality. It simply has count with blocking. It just
needs a coherent and up-to-date-at-the-flush semantic.

Yes, that could work, if I2C core would manage this.

CC1/CC2_VCONN control pins are "GPIO" of anx7688, sort of. They have fixed
purpose of switching external 5V regulator output to one of the CC pins
on type-c port. I don't care what other purpose with some other firmware
someone puts to those pins. It's irrelevant to the use case of anx7688
as a type-c controller/HDMI bridge, which we're describing here.

VCONN regulator is an actual GPIO controlled regulator on the board, and
needs to be controlled by the anx7688 driver. So that CC1/CC2_VCONN control
pins driven by the firmware actually do what they're supposed to do.

Not sure why it would be a business of anything else but anx7688 driver
enabling this regulator, because only this driver knows and cares about this.
If some other board doesn't have the need to manually enable the regulator, or
doesn't have the regulator, it can simply be optional.

There are also some other funky supplies in the bindings, that are not connected
to the chip in any way, but need to be controlled by the driver:

+  vbus-supply: true
+  vbus-in-supply: true

First one can be on the connector node instead, where the driver can fetch
it from.

The purpose of the second one is to link the Phone's PMIC's USB power input with
the type-c controller (anx7688), to make sure the PMIC has information about how
much power it can draw from external PSU.

The second one can be replaced by rewriting the anx7688 driver so that it
creates a power supply representing the USB PSU connected to the phone, and by
linking to anx7688 DT node from x-powers,axp813-usb-power-supply via
a power-supplies property, which would mean that USB input of the phone is
supplied by the external USB PSU. PMIC driver can be modified to watch
the power supply provided by anx7688 driver for information it detected
via USB-PD and update its input current limit via a standard helper function.

This is how eg. fusb302 works. Not sure if that's any better from the PoV of
DT bindings, though. Because power-supplies = <&anx7688>; will not look any
greater in DT bindings, IMO. It will just link the same nodes in the other
direction.

Anyway, the HW is that there's an external PSU (detected by type c controller)
and internal USB power input, and they are connected and one has to respect the
limits of the other. I guess I shouldn't be adding a device node for external PSU,
since it's not part of the phone. But that's what's trully being linked on
HW level.

Kind regards,
	o.

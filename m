Sounds like we dodge the bullet as long as the mappings for BAR 0 are
identical, which doesn't feel like much comfort.

This is the right level of abstraction for the commit log -- sounds
like there's some reset scenario where the pre-reset iATU windows are
not cleared out and we reallocate iATU windows, and we end up using
one of the stale windows instead of the new one, which could lead to
DMA to the wrong area.  That incorrect DMA sounds like data corruption
in the right circumstances.

Of course it can *also* include some detail about the mechanism of why
that stale entry still exists and when it can be used.

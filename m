I don't quite understand this.

If you have two readers on separate subtrees, why is it cheaper to
flush the entire tree in sequence (where both readers don't care about
the majority of the data), than having each reader flush their own
small subset one after another? It's not like the whole tree flush
parallelizes its work.

Where is that overhead actually coming from?

Right, because rstat's do-nothing case is still somewhat costly due to
the per-cpu loop and the tree walk.

But that should be possible to avoid with the outlined caching of
recently-flushed state at the memcg level.

Agreed, it should wait. My mutex would accomplish this, right?

How so?

We need to mark the subgroups that are flushed, so that if you have

	root - a - a1 - foo
                `- a2

and somebody flushes a, then a1 and a2 also don't need to be flushed
for a while.

But if we flush a1 first, foo is aggregated into a1. Reading a still
needs to aggregate a1 and a2 into a.

Maybe I'm missing something blatant, but I don't see how we have to
mark parents in any way. We only have to tag cgroups up to the point
to which they were recently flushed, and we already visit all those.

Let me know if I'm missing something blatant here.

This patch is currently queued for 6.10 so there should be time to get
this sorted.

My fallback plan was to add further (device-specific) default addresses
in case this turned out to be needed (e.g. this is what the Broadcom
driver does).

I assume all Trogdor boards use the same controller, WCN3991 IIUC, but
if you're worried about there being devices out there using a different
address we could possibly also use the new
"qcom,local-bd-address-broken" DT property as an indicator to set the
bdaddr quirk.

We have Qualcomm on CC here so perhaps Janaki, who should have access to
the documentation, can tell us what the default address on these older
controllers looks like?

Janaki, are there further default addresses out there that we need to
consider?

Perhaps "39:98" can even be inferred from the hardware id somehow (cf.
bcm4377_is_valid_bdaddr())?

Doug, could you please also post the QCA version info for Trogdor that's
printed on boot?

Johan

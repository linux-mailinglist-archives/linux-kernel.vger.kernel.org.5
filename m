Sure, whatever we do there's always going to be some unavoidable 
time-of-check-to-time-of-use race window so we can never guarantee that 
sending a request to the device will succeed. I was just making the 
point that if we *have* already detected a surprise removal, then 
cleaning up its leftover driver model state should still generate a 
BUS_NOTIFY_REMOVE_DEVICE call, but in that case we can know there's no 
point trying to send any requests to the device that's already gone.

Thanks,
Robin.

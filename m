The over budget callback lets the driver know its assigned budget and 
its current utilisation. Already with that data drivers could implement 
something smarter than what I did in my RFC. So I don't think callback 
is completely useless even for some smarter implementation which 
potentially ties into firmware scheduling.

Anyway, I maintain this is implementation details.

Okay so essentially nuking the concept of DRM clients belongs to one 
cgroup and instead tracking at the context level. That is an interesting 
idea. I suspect implementation could require somewhat generalizing the 
concept of an "execution context", or at least expressing it via the DRM 
cgroup controller.

I can give this a spin, or at least some more detailed thought, once we 
close on a few more details regarding charging in general.

Yeah, there is some complexity there for sure and could be a larger 
write up. In short per engine stuff tends to work out in practice as is 
given how each driver can decide upon receiving the signal what to do.

In the i915 RFC for instance if it gets "over budget" signal from the 
group, but it sees that the physical engines belonging to this specific 
GPU are not over-subscribed, it simply omits any throttling. Which in 
practice works out fine for two clients competing for different engines. 
Same would be for multiple GPUs (or tiles with our stuff) in the same 
cgroup.

Going back to the single scheduling weight or more fine grained. We 
could choose to follow for instance io.weight format? Start with 
drm.weight being "default 1000" and later extend to per card (or more):

"""
default 100
card0 20
card1 50
"""

In this case I would convert drm.weight to this format straight away for 
the next respin, just wouldn't support per card just yet.

This is a special purpose device file and not a regular file.
Please explain in detail why this violates POSIX and which program breaks.

As pointed out by Miquel, the comment makes it clean that this behavior is
on purpose. If we return now all of a sudden -EBADMSG for the described
scenario we might even break existing MTD userspace.

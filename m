Hi,

Okay, thanks for the clarification. So the point is to plan for adding 
support for Link Width later and currently only support throttling Link 
Speed. In any case, the Link Width control seems to be controlled using 
a different approach (Link Width change does not require Link Retraining).

I don't know either how such 2 dimensioned throttling (Link Speed and 
Link Width) is supposed to be realized using the thermal/cooling device 
interface which only provides a single integer as the current state. That 
is, whether to provide a single cooling device (with a single integer 
exposed to userspace) or separate cooling device for each dimension?

Perhaps thermal people could provide some insight on this? Is there some 
precedent I could take look at?

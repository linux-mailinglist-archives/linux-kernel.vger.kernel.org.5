+cc Andrew: WouldÂ  you mind taking this patchset in your tree for the 
next rc? This patchset depends on a previous fix for arm64 that you 
merged in rc4 which is not in the riscv -fixes branch yet.

I saw with Palmer and he should ack this shortly.

If I can do anything else to help, let me know.

Thanks,

Alex

Yes, using XDP to drop packet will/should relieve the stress, as it
basically can discard some of the 64 packets processed by NAPI vs the 1
packet received by userspace (that re-trigger NAPI), giving a better 
balance.

Marek's tests will likely contain the patch 4cd13c21b207 ("softirq: Let
ksoftirqd do its job") as blog is from 2018 and patch from 2016, but
shouldn't matter much.

True, this is the case I don't know how to solve.

For UDP packets it is NOT optimal to let the process "follow"/run on the 
NAPI-RX CPU. For TCP traffic it is faster to run on same CPU, which 
could be related to GRO effect, or simply that tcp_recvmsg gets a stream 
of data (before it invokes __local_bh_enable_ip causing do_softirq).

I have also tested with netperf UDP packets[2] in a scenario that 
doesn't cause "overload" and CPU have idle cycles.  When UDP-netserver 
is running on same CPU as NAPI then I see approx 38% (82020/216362) 
UdpRcvbufErrors [3] (and separate CPUs 2.8%).  Sure, I could increase 
buffer size, but the point is NAPI can enqueue 64 packet and UDP 
receiver dequeue 1 packet.

This reminded me that kernel have a recvmmsg (extra "m") syscall for 
multiple packets.  I tested this (as udop_sink have support), but no 
luck. This is because internally in the kernel (do_recvmmsg) is just a 
loop over ___sys_recvmsg/__skb_recv_udp, which have a BH-spinlock per 
packet that invokes __local_bh_enable_ip/do_softirq.  I guess, we/netdev 
could fix recvmmsg() to bulk-dequeue from socket queue (BH-socket unlock 
is triggering __local_bh_enable_ip/do_softirq) and then have a solution 
for UDP(?).

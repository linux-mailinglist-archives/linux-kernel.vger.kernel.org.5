Yes, naming is one of the most difficult things.

The reason the helper function uses loff_t instead of ext4_lblk_t is because
when we compute the extent logical end or pa end, we may exceed the
maximum length of ext4_lblk_t and get an overflowed result, which can lead
to the four issues fixed in the patch set. Perhaps I should add some 
comments
to explain these.

In other words, add this helper function and limit the return value of 
the function
to loff_t is precisely to remind people that such overflow problems exist.
As mentioned by ritesh, ext4 has many places to directly perform type 
conversion
in place. However, when we modify the kernel or review code, we will 
still ignore
that the current code may have overflow problems, as in the commit fixed 
by this
patch.

If we have a helper function fex_end(), we can avoid potential overflow 
problems
by using it directly when we make changes or by questioning why we 
didn't use
a simpler helper function when reviewing the code, rather than just 
adding a (loff_t)
when we spot the problem and saying, "Oh, the problem is perfectly 
solved!" 😀

The current problem can be solved in any way, the key is how to prevent 
similar
problems in the future?

Great! Thank you for naming the helper function.

Yes, it is also very important to distinguish between mballoc_extent and 
free_extent.
I will try to rename ext4_free_extent to ext4_mballoc_extent and fix 
some comment
errors in another patch set that does some performance optimizations using
"free extent".

Yes, making code more maintainable is always the goal.
Thank you for your patient explanation!

Cheers!

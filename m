This shouldn't have anything to do with concurrency or shared interrupts 
or anything else. It's simply that we should clearly not attempt to 
migrate a PMU context (via invoking the hotplug callbacks) *after* the 
relevant PMU has already been unregistered, since that's liable to lead 
to some kind of use-after-free, and at best it's just a pointless waste 
of time anyway - if we've got to the point of unbinding the driver (or 
failing to probe at all), there should definitely not be any active 
events or other PMU state that needs updating.

Thanks,
Robin.

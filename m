Thanks for your question.  I added the mptsas maintainers and related
mailing lists.

It looks like your SSDs support SATA r3.3 and are capable of 6.0 Gb/s,
and the SAS1068E SAS controller is limited to 3.0 Gb/s [1].  I would
expect them to negotiate 3.0 Gb/s (as your older drives did) and
you're only seeing 1.5 Gb/s.  Sorry, I guess I just restated your
whole question ;)

I don't know why that would be.  Are there any hints in the dmesg log?
Can you collect the complete dmesg log with the old drives and again
with the new SSDs so we can compare them?  I assume you have good
cables?  I assume the same cables worked at 3.0 Gb/s with the old
drives.

I would *expect* that SATA r3.3 would be completely backwards
compatible, so since mptsas worked just fine at 3.0 Gb/s with the old
SATA r3.0 drives, it should also work just fine at 3.0 Gb/s with the
new SATA r3.3 drives.  But I have no actual knowledge about that.

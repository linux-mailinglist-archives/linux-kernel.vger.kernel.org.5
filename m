Which it doesn't need to be. You are pointlessly making life difficult
for yourself, and everyone else. The MSI bridge behaviour has *zero*
reason to be the same driver as the main "I need it super early"
driver. They may be called the same, but they *are* different things
in the system.

They can share code, but they are fundamentally a different thing in
the system. And I guess this silly approach has other ramifications:
the IMSIC is also some early driver when it really doesn't need to be.
Who needs MSIs that early in the life of the system? I don't buy this
for even a second.

Frankly, this whole thing needs to be taken apart and rebuilt from the
ground up.

You can't have your cake and eat it. If needed super early, and it
cannot be a platform driver. End of the story.

And to my earlier point: IMSIC and APLIC-as-MSI-bridge have no purpose
being early drivers. They must be platform drivers, and only that.

And yet you are hammering it even when told this is wrong.

How about you take a step back and realise that the way you've
architected your drivers makes little sense? I don't think you have
tried *that*.

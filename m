Thanks for correcting my hasty assumption!

Pierre wanted to detect the configuration change and learn the new
num_vfs, which seems like a reasonable thing to do.  Is there a way to
do both via netlink or some other mechanism?

I guess that means that if we apply this revert, the problem Pierre
reported will return.  Obviously the deadlock is more important than
the inconsistency Pierre observed, but from the user's point of view
this will look like a regression.

Maybe listening to netlink and then looking at sysfs isn't the
"correct" way to do this, but I don't want to just casually break
existing user code.  If we do contemplate doing the revert, at the
very least we should include specific details about what the user code
*should* do instead, at the level of the actual commands to use
instead of "ip monitor dev; cat ${path}/device/sriov_numvfs".

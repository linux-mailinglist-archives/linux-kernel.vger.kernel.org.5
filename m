The HW databook I have is named:
"PCI Express DM Controller Databook"
and has the following footnote on every page of the databook:
4.90a
December 2016

The above text is present in the "PCI Express DM Controller Databook" I
mentioned above that I have with me which I have cited as-is. I am certain that
the Databook version I have with me is v4.90a. Additionally, please refer to the
commit which added support to the PCI Keystone driver for AM654x Platform:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/18b0415bc802#diff-1a6482b4ef0eddbe6238232ad346930283832b99270ebabd67385571a619c267R977

The value of the register PCIE_RC_PCIE_VERSION_NUMBER_OFF is:
3439302a
which in ASCII is 490*
The value of the register PCIE_RC_PCIE_VERSION_TYPE_OFF is:
6c703039
which in ASCII is lp09.

So I am certain that the Controller is actually version 4.90.

Please note that irrespective of anything else, with no dependence on any prior
discussions, what remains true is that commit 6ab15b5e7057:
PCI: dwc: keystone: Convert .scan_bus() callback to use add_bus
introduced a bug. Therefore, I believe that the fix will be to attempt to
restore the driver's state back to what it was prior to commit 6ab15b5e7057, as
gracefully as possible, without having to revert commit 6ab15b5e7057.

In the process of converting .scan_bus() callbacks to .add_bus(),
.scan_bus method was removed from:
static const struct dw_pcie_host_ops ks_pcie_host_ops = {
	.host_init = ks_pcie_host_init,
	.msi_host_init = ks_pcie_msi_host_init,
	.scan_bus = ks_pcie_v3_65_scan_bus,
};

and added as a .add_bus method to:
static struct pci_ops ks_pcie_ops = {
	.map_bus = dw_pcie_own_conf_map_bus,
	.read = pci_generic_config_read,
	.write = pci_generic_config_write,
	.add_bus = ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus,
};
in addition to renaming the method.

Even before commit 6ab15b5e7057, with support for AM654x (using version 4.90a
DWC PCIe IP-core) already present, ks_pcie_ops was being used for AM654x. This
indicates that prior to commit 6ab15b5e7057, the ks_pcie_ops was applicable to
AM654x and there's no problem. However, when commit 6ab15b5e7057 converted the
.scan_bus() method in ks_pcie_host_ops (which wasn't used for AM654x) to
.add_bus(), it added the method within the shared ks_pcie_ops structure which
implicitly, *mistakenly*, assumes that a function named "ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus"
is also applicable to other controller versions (4.90a in this case). Paying
attention to the name of the function, it becomes clear that it was added for
controller version "3.65", hence the name "...v3_65...". The assumption that the
function/method is applicable to other controller versions as well, was
incorrect which led to the current issue that can be observed. The commit
6ab15b5e7057 ended up adding a new method for a controller version which *never*
used the method. This therefore is a bug.

The simplest fix I see is that of exiting ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus() if:
ks_pcie->is_am6 is set, since such checks have been scattered throughout the
same driver prior to the addition of commit 6ab15b5e7057 as well.

I am open to other implementations of fixing this issue as well. Kindly let me
know in case of any suggestions.

I tried to avoid the above extra calculation (although it should be
tiny), since it's in a NMI handler. So I once planned to add an extra
struct perf_branch_entry_ext    lbr_entries_ext[MAX_LBR_ENTRIES]; which
doubles the space.
But yes, it should be doable.

I don't see big drawbacks to it. Easier to understand and implement, so
should be easier to maintain as well.
I guess I will still use the latter, if no objection.

Users may only collect the occurrences of some events in a group. The
EVT_CNTRS flag is used to indicate those events. E.g.,
perf record -e "{cpu/branch-instructions,branch_type=call/,
cpu/branch-misses,branch_type=event/}"

Only the occurrences of the branch-misses event is collected in LBR and
finally dumped into the extra buffer.

While the first flag, PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_EXTRA, only tells that the
extra space is required.

Now, it's documented in the IntelÂ® Architecture Instruction Set
Extensions and Future Features, Chapter 8, 8.6 LBR ENHANCEMENTS. It
should be moved to SDM later.
https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/671368

Only 2 bits for each counter. Saturating at a value of 3.

Hi, Ulf

Excuse me, may I know the patch's status?

If you already have a closer look at a paragraph in the series,
could you let me know your comments first, let me check it first.

I look forward to your reply.

Thanks, Victor Shih

> ----------------- original cover letter from v3.1 -----------------
> This is an interim snapshot of our next version, v4, for enabling
> UHS-II on MMC/SD.
>
> It is focused on 'sdhci' side to address Adrian's comments regarding
> "modularising" sdhci-uhs2.c.
> The whole aim of this version is to get early feedback from Adrian (and
> others) on this issue. Without any consensus about the code structure,
> it would make little sense to go further ahead on sdhci side.
> (Actually, Adrian has made no comments other than "modularising" so far.)
>
> I heavily reworked/refactored sdhci-uhs2.c and re-organised the patch
> set to meet what I believe Adrian expects; no UHS-II related code in
> Legacy (UHS-I) code or sdhci.c.
>
> Nevertheless, almost of all changes I made are trivial and straightforwar=
d
> in this direction, and I believe that there is no logic changed since v3
> except sdhci_uhs2_irq(), as ops->irq hook, where we must deal with UHS-II
> command sequences in addition to UHS-II errors. So I added extra handling=
s.
>
> I admit that there is plenty of room for improvements (for example,
> handling host->flags), but again the focal point here is how sdhci-uhs2.c
> should be built as a module.
>
> Please review this series (particularly Patch#8-#26 and #27) from this
> viewpoint in the first place.
> (Ben is working on 'host' side but there is no change on 'host' side

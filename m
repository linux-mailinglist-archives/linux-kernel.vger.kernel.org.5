We're on v6.1, which is the latest LTS (I mentioned it in the first
message). It has this patch included and my commit mentions it in the
very first line of the description.

I should've also mentioned commit fd25a9e0e23b ("memcg: unify memcg
stat flushing") from the same series, which my patch is partially
reverting.

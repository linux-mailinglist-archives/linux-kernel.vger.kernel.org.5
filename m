Hi Rafael,

A change of direction here, regarding your comment below.

I have discussed with one of our partners your comment about 2 tables.
They would like to have this runtime modified EM in other places
as well: DTPM and thermal governor. So you had good gut feeling.

In the past in our IPA (thermal gov ~2016 and kernel v4.14) we
had two callbacks:
- get_static_power() [1]
- get_dynamic_power() [2]

Later ~2017/2018 v4.16 the static power mechanism was removed
completely by this commit 84fe2cab48590e4373978e4e.
The way how it was design, implemented and used justified that
decision. We later used EM in the cpu cooling which also only
had dynamic power information.

The PID mechanism in IPA tries to compensate that
missing information (about changed static power in time or a chip
binning) and adjusts the 'error'. How good and fast that is in all
situations - it's a different story (out of this scope).
So, IPA should not be worse with the runtime table.

The static power was on the chips and probably will be still.
You might remember my slide 13 from OSPM2024 showing two power
usage plots for the same Big CPU and 1.4GHz fixed (50% of fmax):
- w/ GPU working in the background using 1-1.5W
- w/o GPU in the background

The same workload run on Big, but power bigger is ~15% higher
after ~1min.

The static power (leakage) is the issue that this patch tries
to address for EAS. Although, there is not only the leakage.
It's about the whole 'profile', which can be different than what
could be built during boot default information.

So we would want to go for one single table in EM, which
is runtime modifiable.

That is something that you might be more confident and we would
have less diversity (2 tables) in the kernel.

Regards,
Lukasz

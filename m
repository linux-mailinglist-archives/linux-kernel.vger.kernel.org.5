Hi Doug,

Apologies for the delay.

Ignoring the soundness issues I mentioned before (which I'm slowly chipping
away at, and you're likely lucky enough to avoid in practice)...

Having looked over the series, I think the GICv3 bit isn't quite right, but is
easy enough to fix. I've commented on the patch with what I think we should
have there.

The only major thing otherwise from my PoV is the structure of the debug IPI
framework. I'm not keen on that being a separate body of code and I think it
should live in smp.c along with the other IPIs. I'd also strongly prefer if we
could have separate IPI_CPU_BACKTRACE and IPI_CPU_KGDB IPIs, and I think we can
do that either by unifying IPI_CPU_STOP && IPI_CPU_CRASH_STOP or by reclaiming
IPI_WAKEUP by reusing a different IPI for the parking protocol (e.g.
IPI_RESCHEDULE).

I think it'd be nice if the series could enable NMIs for backtrace and the
CPU_{,CRASH_}STOP cases, with KGDB being the bonus atop. That way it'd be
clearly beneficial for anyone trying to debug lockups even if they're not a
KGDB user.

Thanks for the pointer!

I know that there are a couple of things that we could do to slightly improve
local_irq_*() when using pNMIs, though I suspect that the bulk of the cost
there will come from the necessary synchronization.

Thanks,
Mark.

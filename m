Yes, I have tested on my aspire e471 notebook (i5 5200U),
because that notebook using legacy firmware (also have UEFI, double firmware).
But this machine have difficult in install ubuntu under UEFI firmware in the past.
So I keep it using the legacy firmware.

It have two video card, IGD and nvidia video card(GFORCE 840M).
nvidia call its video card as 3D controller (pci->class = 0x030200)

I have tested this patch and another patch mention at [1] together.
I can tell you that the firmware framebuffer of this notebook using vesafb, not efifb.
And the framebuffer size (lfb.size) is very small. This is very strange,
but I don't have enough time to look in details. But still works.

I'm using and tesing my patch whenever and wherever possible.

What you tell me here is the side effect come with the VGA-compatible,
but I'm focus on the arbitration itself. I think there no need to keep
the VGA routing hardware features nowadays except that hardware vendor
want keep the backward compatibility and/or comply the PCI VGA compatible spec.

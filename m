This series (patch 04/21 "ACPI: irq: Add support for deferred probe in
acpi_register_gsi()" [1]) makes acpi_register_gsi() return
-EPROBE_DEFER, which percolates up through pci_enable_device().

Maybe that's ok, but this affects *all* PCI drivers, and it's a new
case that did not occur before.  Many drivers emit warning or error
messages for any pci_enable_device() failure, which you probably don't
want in this case, since -EPROBE_DEFER is not really a "failure";
IIUC, it just means "probe again later."

Are these PNP/INTx GSI devices described in ACPI?  In the namespace?
Or in a static table?

I guess PCI interrupts from the PCI host bridges (PNP0A03 devices)
feed into the APLIC?  And APLIC is described via MADT?  Based on this
series, it looks like this:

    acpi_init
  +   acpi_riscv_init
  +     riscv_acpi_aplic_platform_init
  +       acpi_table_parse_madt(ACPI_MADT_TYPE_APLIC, aplic_parse_madt, 0)
      acpi_scan_init
        acpi_pci_root_init
        acpi_pci_link_init
	acpi_bus_scan             # add PCI host bridges, etc

If that's the sequence, it looks like aplic_parse_madt() should be
called before the PCI host bridges are added.

Or maybe this isn't how the APLICs are enumerated?

I don't think a link in L2 (main power off) can lead to a device in
D3hot, can it?  I assume that a device in D3hot can be returned to D0
by a config write to the PM CSR, and the link must be usable for that.

The kernel can't directly control the internal behavior of the device,
but the behavior that's observable on the PCIe link should always
conform to the spec.

Do you see devices where a transition to D3hot may cause some kind of
non-compliant behavior on the link?  If so, then I guess we have to
consider whether to quirk them avoid D3hot completely or to work
around it somehow.

So simply putting the device in D3hot restarts firmware on the device?
And it starts sending PTM requests after the restart?  I *assume* that
at least it only sends the PTM requests if the PTM Enable bit is set,
right?  That shouldn't cause us trouble unless we configured something
wrong.

I am planning to send a v3 of the series soon, once I have
confirmed that the bugs in patch 3 have all been fixed.

I have no strong opinion on whether or not patch 3 gets
merged at all. Patches 1 & 2 fix the actual bug that I am
trying to fix, and I am perfectly fine if patch 3 ends up
getting dropped in the end.

It seemed worth trying to get that cleanup though ;)

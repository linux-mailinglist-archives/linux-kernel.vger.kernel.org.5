I didn't make it yesterday either - was having to juggle child care.

I don't dispute that this sounds like it could be beneficial, but I see it as
research to happen further down the road (as you say), and we don't know what
that research might conclude. Also, I think the scope of this is bigger than
anonymous memory - you would also likely want to look at the policy for page
cache folio order too, since today that's based solely on readahead. So I see it
as an optimization that is somewhat orthogonal to small-sized THP.

The proposed interface does not imply any preference order - it only states
which sizes the user wants the kernel to select from, so I think there is lots
of freedom to change this down the track if the kernel wants to start using the
buddy allocator's state as a signal to make its decisions.

My point was that in an abstract sense, there are properties a user may wish to
apply individually to a size, which is catered for by having a per-size
directory into which we can add more files if/when requirements for new per-size
properties arise. There are also properties that may be applied globally, for
which we have the top-level transparent_hugepage directory where properties can
be extended or added.

For your case around tighter integration with the buddy allocator, I could
imagine a per-size file allowing the user to specify if the kernel should allow
splitting a higher order to make a THP of that size (I'm not suggesting that's a
good idea, I'm just pointing out that this sort of thing is possible with the
interface). And we have discussed how the global enabled prpoerty could be
extended to support "auto" [1].

But perhaps what we really need are lots more ideas for future directions for
small-sized THP to allow us to evaluate this interface more widely.

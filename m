I agree with creating a shared git tree from the start... I currently don't have
a kernel.org account yet, as I'm waiting for helpdesk to grant my account request.

They asked me to send a patch adding myself to MAINTAINERS as they would use that
as a basis to grant the account request... so I guess it's happening soon; seen
the urgency, I would do anything in my power to speed up the process, but probably
there's "nothing to do" about it.

I am guessing that the right thing to do right now is to just send the mostly
critical fixes to soc@kernel.org, along with this patch, and wait until a shared
tree is created to keep things clean?

Many thanks for your support, I greatly appreciate that.

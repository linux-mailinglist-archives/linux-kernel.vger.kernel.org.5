Many of the server parts have a deepest idle state around 600us, distros
have HZ=250. So every idle 600us < x < 4000us would unnecessarily
disable the tick.

How often this happens is of course workload dependent, but if unlucky
it could be a lot. It also adds the above mentioned latency to the idle
state, which for those parts is a significant chunk of the exit latency
extra.

The fix is 'trivial', why not do it?

Anyway, let me post my latest hackery :-)

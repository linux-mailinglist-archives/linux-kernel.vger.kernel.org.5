For now I'd prefer we took the patch I sent in:

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/ZRr8r7XMoyDKaitd@FVFF77S0Q05N.cambridge.arm.com/

... as that leaves us no worse than before this series, and it's pretty simple.

Going further than the above, I think there are three options here:

1) Complete fix: depend on a working firmware, and throw this workaround away.

   IIUC from the above, that's not something you can commit to.

2) Partial fix: have the kernel save/restore everything.

   IIUC this is unpalatable.

3) Partial fix: make the ARM64_HAS_GIC_PRIO_MASKING cpucap depend on the
   absence of a "mediatek,broken-save-restore-fw" property in the DT. I believe
   we can check that in early_enable_pseudo_nmi() or can_use_gic_priorities().

   That'll avoid potential issues if/when we change the priorities used for
   pNMI (which is something I've been looking at).

I'm happy with (3) if Marc is.

Mark.

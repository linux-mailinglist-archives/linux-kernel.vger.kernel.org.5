I hope I was able to clarify to you in other threads that VA pages are not  
placed in any queue/list until [PATCH v5 11/18] x86/sgx: store  
unreclaimable pages in LRU lists.

This patch is the first one to implement tracking for unreclaimable pages.  
I'll add that as a transition hint.

Yes will do

Yes basically tracking them in cgroups as they are allocated.

VAs and SECS may also come and go as swapping/unswapping happens. But if a  
cgroup is OOM, and all reclaimables are gone (swapped out), it'd have to  
reclaim VAs/SECs in the same cgroup starting from the front of the LRU  
list. To reclaim a VA/SECS, it identifies the enclave from the owner of  
the VA/SECS page and kills it, as killing enclave is the only way to  
reclaim VA/SECS pages.

I already wrote a patch which addresses this together with the caller=20

Indeed, it looks the step by step changed didn't yield good result here.

How do you get the LBMS set in the first place? Isn't that because the=20
link tries to come up so shouldn't it reassert that bit again before the=20
code ends up into the target speed quirk? That is, I assumed you actually=
=20
wanted to detect LBMS getting set during pcie_wait_for_link_status() call=
=20
preceeding pcie_failed_link_retrain() call?

There's always an option to store it into pci_dev for later use when the=20
quirk is found to be working for the first time if other solutions don't=20
work.

In any case and unrelated to this patch, the way this quirk monopolizes=20
LBMS bit is going to have to be changed because it won't be reliable with=
=20
the PCIe BW controller that sets up and irq for LBMS (and clears the bit).
In bwctrl v5 (yet to be posted) I'll add LBMS counter into bwctrl to allow=
=20
this quirk to keep working (which will need to be confirmed).

Yes, when resuming the device is already gone but the bridge still has=20
LBMS set. My understanding is that it was set because it was there
from pre-suspend time but I've not really taken a deep look into it=20
because the problem and fix seemed obvious.

I read that "without the Port transitioning through DL_Down status"=20
differently than you, I only interpret that it relates to the two=20
bullets following it. ...So if retrain bit is set, and link then goes=20
down, the bullet no longer applies and LBMS should not be set because=20
there was transition through DL_Down. But I could well be wrong...

I'll make the water muddier (hopefully clearer?). I have access to the
board schematic (not SIP/SOM stuff though), but that should help here.

MAC0 owns its own MDIO bus (we'll call it MDIO0). It is pinmuxed to
gpio8/gpio9 for mdc/mdio. MAC1 owns its own bus (MDIO1) which is
pinmuxed to gpio21/22.

On MDIO0 there are two SGMII ethernet phys. One is connected to MAC0,
one is connected to MAC1.

MDIO1 is not connected to anything on the board. So there is only one
MDIO master, MAC0 on MDIO0, and it manages the ethernet phy for both
MAC0/MAC1.

Does that make sense? I don't think from a hardware design standpoint
this is violating anything, it isn't a multimaster setup on MDIO.

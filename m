I mean, yeah, that's a separate issue or rather a subset which isn't all
that controversial. That can be deterministically solved by reparenting to
the parent like how slab is handled. I think the "deterministic" part is
important here. As you said, even a single page can pin a dying cgroup.

This is the point that Johannes raised but I don't think the current
proposal would make things more deterministic. From what I can see, it
actually pushes it towards even less predictability. Currently, yeah, some
pages may end up in cgroups which aren't the majority user but it at least
is clear how that would happen. The proposed change adds layers of
indeterministic behaviors on top. I don't think that's the direction we want
to go.

I'm not disagreeing on that. Our handling of pages owned by dying cgroups
isn't great but I don't think the proposed change is an acceptable solution.

Thanks.

It seems there may be a justification for some form of SHA-1 support in this
feature.  As I've said, the problem is that it's not explained in the patchset
itself.  Rather, it just talks about "SHA" and pretends like SHA-1 and SHA-2 are
basically the same.  In fact, SHA-1 differs drastically from SHA-2 in terms of
security.  SHA-1 support should be added in a separate patch, with a clearly
explained rationale *in the patch itself* for the SHA-1 support *specifically*.

Exactly. It's only for reducing the number of variable passing.

Exactly again. The ext4_mark_context is based on ext4_allocation_context.

Actually, I try to put stable arguments need by bit mark into
ext4_mark_context then ext4_mark_context could be initialized once and used
multiple times. For example, if there is function to mark multiple bit
fragments, it will use ext4_allocation_context as:
 struct ext4_mark_context mc = {
   /* initialization */
 }
 /* mark fragment1 */
 ext4_mb_mark_group_bb(&mc, group1, blkoff1, len1);
 /* mark fragment2 */
 ext4_mb_mark_group_bb(&mc, group2, blkoff2, len2);
And I thinks these stable arguments match "context" meaning which bit
mark needed to work around :).

Put bit mark relevant information into ext4_mark_context is absolutely
a great choice. I will arrange ext4_mark_context in this way if you
still prefer this.

Yes, prepare function is a great idea. I will add this in next version.

Thanks! this means a lot to me!

No. Order of preference would be turn on the minimal if that is enough.
First item is the highest preference (if the requested channels are a subset of
that we don't look any further).  Here that means we always stop on the first
entry and never look at the second.

Interesting - you have cases where it's not valid at all?
It sometimes becomes inaccurate because we are interpolating across
data from a fifo, but I've not seen a case where we can't provide anything
useful.  Ah well - as you say I'll wait for that later series!

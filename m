The subject is slightly inaccurate as this doesn't touch pciehp source
files, although it is *related* to pciehp.

As an example, a perhaps more accurate subject might be something like...

  PCI/DPC: Ignore Surprise Down errors on hot removal

...but I don't think it's necessary to respin just for that as Bjorn is
probably able to adjust the subject to his liking when applying the patch.

Thanks a lot for patiently pursuing this issue, good to see it fixed.

Five years ago there was an attempt to solve it through masking Surprise
Down errors, which you've verified to not be a viable approach:

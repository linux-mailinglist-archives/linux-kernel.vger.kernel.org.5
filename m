I wasn't able to find a way to let LSM pin initramfs/initrd during mount 
time. But I think we could replace the global variable with a flag 
variable ipe_sb_state so we could use atomic operation to only mark one 
drive as pinned without any lock. The code will be like:

static void pin_sb(const struct super_block *sb)
{
	if (!sb)
		return;

	if (!test_and_set_bit_lock(IPE_SB_PINNED, &ipe_sb_state)) {
		ipe_sb(sb)->pinned = true;
	}
}

Would this sound better?

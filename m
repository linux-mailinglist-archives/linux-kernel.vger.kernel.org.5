Well, thanks for you tell me this. You know more than me and definitely have a better understanding.

Are you telling me that the POST function for AMDGPU reside in the BIOS?
The kernel call into the BIOS?
Does the BIOS here refer to the UEFI runtime or ATOM BIOS or something else?

But the POST function for the drm ast, reside in the kernel space (in other word, in ast.ko).
Is this statement correct?

I means that for ASpeed BMC chip, if the firmware not POST the display controller.
Then we have to POST it at the kernel space before doing various modeset option.
We can only POST this chip by directly operate the various registers.
Am I correct for the judgement about ast drm driver?

Thanks for your reviews.

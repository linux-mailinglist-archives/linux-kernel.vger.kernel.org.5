Hopefully Fan can comment on that, unless I'm forgetting some
implementation details it seems like a reasonable request.

While I think the commit description does provide a reasonable summary
of IPE as it relates to fsverify, I agree that the specifics of the
changes presented in the patch are lacking.  Fan, could you update the
commit description to add a paragraph explaining what IPE would do in
the security_inode_setsecurity() hook called from within
fsverity_inode_setsecurity()?

Fan can surely elaborate on this more, but my understanding is that
IPE can help provide the missing authorization piece.

We are getting a bit beyond the integration of IPE and fsverity so I
don't want to spend a lot of time here, but IPE and IMA work quite a
bit differently as they serve different purposes.  IPE provides a file
authorization mechanism that grants access based on the specified
policy and the file's underlying backing store; IPE does not measure
files like IMA to provide additional integrity checking, it relies on
the storage medium's integrity mechanisms.

I have no doubt Fan could provide a much better summary if needed, and
of course there are the documentation patches in the patchset too.

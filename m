The entire reboot_pid_ns thing is just a polite way of keeping
applications like /sbin/reboot working inside a pid namespace.

Ordinarily the process calling reboot (inside the container) won't
have the privileges to request an entire system reboot.  So I don't
see anything making sense to promote that reboot into a system-wide
reboot.

Which leads me to the question.  What is actually happening with
hibernation that we want something inside a pid namespace to somehow
have the permissions to reboot the entire machine?

Someone has a task inside a container that is successfully suspending
the entire system?

I don't see how that makes sense.

But on the level that it somehow does I would put a test in
kernel/reboot.c something like:

/*
 * If the caller can't perform a normal reboot call
 * reboot_pid_ns
 */
if ((pid_ns != &init_pid_ns) &&
    !((current->flags & PF_SUSPEND_TASK) && capable(CAP_SYS_BOOT))) {
	return reboot_pid_ns(pid_ns, cmd);
}

Making reboot_pid_ns responsible for the logic that should be bypassing
it is quite confusing.

I really don't know if allowing PF_SUSPEND_TASK so that hibernation and
the like can work from inside a container makes any sense at all.

But the above is roughly how I would make it work.

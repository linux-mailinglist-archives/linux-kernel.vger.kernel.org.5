Hmm.  That sounds potentially interesting.  I assume you're talking
about something like this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JKH5VTL

I'm not familiar with the timing requirements for something like this.
There is a PCIe M.2 spec with some timing requirements, but I don't
know whether or how software is supposed to manage this.  There is a
T_PVPGL (power valid to PERST# inactive) parameter, but it's
implementation specific, so I don't know what the point of that is.
And I don't see a way for software to even detect the presence of such
an adapter.

But I assume some end users will use adapters like this and expect it
to "just work," so it would be nice if it did.

Even though the product may be end-of-life, people will probably still
try to use it, and I would like it to work.  Otherwise we end up with
frustrated users and problem reports that are hard to resolve.  But I
don't know where to go here.

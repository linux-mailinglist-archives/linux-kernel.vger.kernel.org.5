Thanks for the report and the logs, which are attached at
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=218050

I think the problem is that the MMCONFIG region is at
[mem 0x80000000-0x8fffffff], and that is *also* included in one of the
host bridge windows reported via _CRS:

  PCI: MMCONFIG for domain 0000 [bus 00-ff] at [mem 0x80000000-0x8fffffff] (base 0x80000000)
  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0x80000000-0xfbffffff window]

I'll try to figure out how to deal with that.  In the meantime, would
you mind attaching the contents of /proc/iomem to the bugzilla?  I
think you have to cat it as root to get the actual values included.

Bjorn

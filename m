Not really.  The ack callback is always effective no matter whether
the stream is transferred via mmap or read/write.  So, when you
implement a la packet transfer via ack callback, it works for both
mmap and read/write.  It's used typically for drivers doing a
packet-based transfer, e.g. FireWire drivers or USB-audio.

OTOH, if you'd like to drop the intermediate ring buffer (enabled by
snd_pcm_set_managed_buffer_all() and allocated/freed automatically at
hw_params/hw_free in PCM core), you can implement PCM copy and
fill_ops methods.  But in this case, you can't copy to
runtime->dma_area like your patch; you may need a temporary buffer of
your own, or handle directly the user pointer.

And, even with copy/fill_ops implementations, mmap itself isn't
prohibited when the driver provides its own mmap call.  This can be
seen, for example, when a driver uses the iomem region as the data
ring buffer.

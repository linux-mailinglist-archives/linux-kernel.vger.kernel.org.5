Unfortunately it comes with an experience. The problem here is the absence of
Documentation for the headers that guarantee inclusion of other headers. In
general linux/* are preferred over asm/* but sometimes things are complicated
(when some asm ones include linux ones via architectural code and circling
around).

Have you checked Ingo Molnar's gigantic series (2k+ patches) for the header
hell clean up? Perhaps we need to apply that first.

I'm not saying about MADV_PAGEOUT, but the logic of ther user of MADV_PAGEOUT,
which being used for finding the pages to reclaim.

Ok, I agree the time gap is small enough and the benefit could be significant
on such use case.  Thank you for enlightening me with the nice examples and the
numbers :)

tl;dr
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jirislaby/linux.git/commit/?h=devel&id=9abb593df5a9b9b72d13438f1862ca67936f6b66

----

Yes, sorry, my bad -- I forgot to elaborate on why this is "part I." and 
what is going to be part II., III., ...

So yeah, I have more in my queue which is growing a lot. I had to cut it 
at some point as I was losing myself in all the changes already. So I 
flushed this "part I.". It is only a minimalistic change in the core and 
necessary changes in drivers' hooks. Parts II. and on will spread this 
more, of course. Ideally, to every single loop in every driver ;) (in 
long-term).

I still have a bunch of changes for tty_buffer and n_tty in my queue. As 
soon as I rebase on the today's -next which is already supposed to 
contain this part I., I will send part II. with these changes. I could 
have merged those II. changes to some earlier I. patches. At first, I 
actually did try, but the patches were growing with more and more 
dependencies, so I stopped this approach. Instead, I separated the 
changes per the core/ldisc/drivers. The parts are self-contained, 
despite it might look like the changes are incomplete (i.e. not 
everything is changed everywhere). After all, I wanted to avoid one 
hundred+ patches series.

thanks,

Good point. I haven't checked this in detail yet, but if
CONFIG_CGROUP_FAVOR_DYNMODS has the same behavior then I wouldn't worry
much about this. Also, I don't know how common it is to unmount and
mount a cgroup hierarchies (if it's not so common then it's even
less important).

We could also investigate on how to make the flag stick as a follow
up work on this.

The main motivation for this patch is really v1 since we can
simply remount v2 with favordynmods enabled (although we do
find this very useful for v2 as well).

Another crazy idea (based on your suggestion to allow only this
controllable in v2), would be to make favordynmods enabled by
default in v1 w/ the rationale that new behavior changes affect
only v2.

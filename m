Aside from this being just plain gross, this also destroys determinism
of futex_pi, which completely defeats the purpose of the whole thing.


Now.. the reason we need hb->lock at this point is to avoid the
wake_futex_pi() -EAGAIN case.

This happens when futex_top_waiter() and rt_mutex_top_waiter() state
becomes inconsistent. The current rules are such that this inconsistency
will not be observed.

Notably the case that needs to be avoided is where futex_lock_pi() and
futex_unlock_pi() interleave such that unlock will fail to observe a new
waiter.

*However* the case at hand is where a waiter is leaving, in this case
what happens is that we'll fail to observe a waiter that is already
gone, which is harmless afaict.

Would not something like the below work instead?

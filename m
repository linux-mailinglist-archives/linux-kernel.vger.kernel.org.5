It seems that I didn't fully understand Martin's suggestion. I was
confused by the advice to remove the notifier block and tried to explain
why it's not possible. However, I believe it is reasonable to protect
the cpu_fselX from rate propagation, because it is symmetric, as you
mentioned.

Based on my understanding, the minimum frequency that sys_pll can
provide is not relevant. The CPU fixed clock is considered a "safety"
clock, and I can confidently connect the cpu_clk parent to that stable
clock without any issues. CCF will decide which parent will be used in
the end of rate changing process.

Why? Per my understanding, CPU fixed clock guarantees this behaviour.

Sorry for wrong terminology. I meant that sys_pll cannot be used as a
clock source (clock parent) while we are changing its rate.

In the case for which notifier block was applied - cpu_clk and sys_pll
rate propagation.

I'm afraid, this is terminology miss from my side again. By 'sys_pll
lock' I mean rate lock using CLK_SET_RATE_GATE. I want to say that we
can't prohibit rate propagation of sys_pll chain, because we want to
change the rate, this is our main goal.

Okay. As I mentioned in another email reply, in order to make it happen,
it is required to move the sys_pll clock to the a1-cpu driver. However,
I thought that this approach may not be correct from a logical
perspective. I will try.

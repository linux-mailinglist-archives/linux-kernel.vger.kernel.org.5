Option 2 definitely makes sense to me and I agree that it would be cleaner to
have 2 separate APIs, one for small-page accounting (which can accept a range
within a folio) and one for large-page accounting (i.e. compound=true in today's
API).

But...

1) That's not how the rest of the rmap API does it

2) This would be a much bigger change since I'm removing an existing API and
replacing it with a completely new one (there are ~20 call sites to fix up). I
was trying to keep the change small and manageable by maintaining the current
API but moving all the small-page logic to the new API, so the old API is a
wrapper in that case.

3) You would also need an API for the hugetlb case, which page_remove_rmap()
handles today. Perhaps that could also be done by the new API that handles the
compound case. But then you are mixing and matching your API styles - one caters
for 1 specific case, and the other caters for 2 cases and figures out which one.

I'm open to doing the work to remove this redundancy, but I'd like to hear
concensus on this thread that its the right approach first. Although personally
I don't see a problem with what I've already done; If you want to operate on a
page (inc the old concept of a "compound page" and a hugetlb page) call the old
one. If you want to operate on a range of pages in a folio, call the new one.

Thanks,
Ryan

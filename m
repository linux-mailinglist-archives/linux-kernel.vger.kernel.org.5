NO, it won't work and that's the reason the Qcom platforms are not transitioning
the link to L2/L3 state during suspend. This applies to other platforms
including layerscape as well.

I'm referring to the platform where these helper functions are being used which
is layerscape. It doesn't matter whether you test this series with NVMe or not,
it will not work unless you disable ASPM.

You are missing my point here. If any platform decides to use these helper
functions, they will face problems with NVMe. So please add a check for ASPM
state before doing any L2/L3 handling.

I agree that it may not be optimal w.r.t power savings, but the PCIe controller
driver should work for all devices.

This could be a valid use case though if people intend to share EPCs  
between two VMs. Understand no one would be able to use VMs this way  
currently with the static allocation.

 From this perspective, I think the current implementation is  
"well-defined": EPC cgroup limits for VMs are only enforced at VM launch  
time, not runtime. In practice,  SGX VM can be launched only with fixed  
EPC size and all those EPCs are fully committed to the VM once launched.  
Because of that, I imagine people are using VMs to primarily partition the  
physical EPCs, i.e, the static size itself is the 'limit' for the workload  
of a single VM and not expecting EPCs taken away at runtime.

So killing does not really add much value for the existing usages IIUC.

That said, I don't anticipate adding the enforcement of killing VMs at  
runtime would break such usages as admin/user can simply choose to set the  
limit equal to the static size to launch the VM and forget about it.

Given that, I'll propose an add-on patch to this series as RFC and have  
some feedback from community before we decide if that needs be included in  
first version or we can skip it until we have EPC reclaiming for VMs.

Thanks
Haitao

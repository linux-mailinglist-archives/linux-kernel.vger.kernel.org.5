Agreed that it makes sense to define a broad interface.  We have
some hardware focused drivers we can't share yet (IP rules until
a release date in the near future) where this is a reasonable fit
- but indeed there are others such as mapping this to DDR ECS
where it isn't a great mapping.

I'd love to come up with an interface that has the right blend
of generality and flexibility.  That is easiest done before we have
any implementation merged.

There is a bit of a chicken and egg problem here. Until there is 
reasonable support in kernel (or it looks like there will be),
BIOS teams push back on a requirement to add the tables.
I'd encourage no one to bother with RASF - RAS2 is much less
ambiguous.

Next bit is kind of an aside as I mostly agree with your conclusions ;)

This obviously depends on your memory interleave. You want to present
physical address ranges as single controllable regions - probably
most interesting being stuff that maps to NUMA nodes.  The short
answer is that any firmware control will end up writing to all the
memory controllers involved in a given PA range - firmware can easily
establish which those are.

A memory controller can support multiple scrub regions
which map from a PA range to a particular set of RAM addresses
- that's implementation specific. The memory controller is getting
the host PA and can carry out appropriate hashing if it wants to.
Many scrub solutions won't do this - in which case it's max one
region per memory controller (mapped by firmware to one region per
interleave set - assuming interleave sets take in whole memory
controllers - which they normally do).

I would expect existing systems (not design with this differentiated
scrub in mind) to only support scrub control by PA range at the
granularity of interleave sets.

Note that this general question of PA based controls also
maps to things like resource control (resctl) where it's only interesting
to partition memory bandwidth such that the partition applies to the
whole interleave set - that's done for ARM systems anyway by having
the userspace interface pretend there is only one control, but
write the settings to all actual controllers involved. Not sure what
x86 does.

Taking a few examples that I know of.  All 4 socket server - with
control of these as bios options ;).
Assuming individual memory controllers don't allow scrub to be
configured by PA range.

1. Full system memory interleave (people do this form of crazy)
   In that case, there is only one set of firmware controls
   that write to the interfaces of every memory controller.  Depending
   on the interleave design that may still allow multiple regions.
  
2. Socket wide memory interleave.  In that case, firmware controls
   need to effect all memory controllers in that socket if the
   requested 'region' maps to them.  So 4 PA regions. 

3. Die wide memory interleave.  Finer granularity of control
   so perhaps 8 PA rgiones.

4. Finer granularity (there are reasons to do this for above mentioned
   bandwidth resource control which you can only do if not interleaving
   across multiple controllers).

I more or less agree, but would tweak a little.

1) Allow for multiple regions per memory controller - that's needed
   for RASF etc anyway - because as far as they are concerned there
   is only one interface presented.
2) Tie the interface to interleave sets, not memory controllers.
   NUMA nodes often being a good stand in for those.
   Controlling memory controllers separately for parts of an interleave
   isn't something I'd think was very useful.  This will probably get
   messy in the future though and the complexity could be pushed to
   a userspace tool - as long as enough info is available elsewhere
   in sysfs.  So need those memory controller directories you propose
   to include info on the PA ranges that they are involved in backing
   (which to keep things horrible, can change at runtime via memory
    hotplug and remapping of host physical address ranges on CXL etc)

No particular harm in the rename of the directory I guess.
Though some of those 'memory_controllers' would be virtual as they
wouldn't correspond to actual memory controllers but rather to
sets of them.

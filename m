I revive this quite old topic.

The primary goal of this series was to avoid a struct device duplication due
to the insertion of DT nodes related to PCI devices.
The series added the sysfs of_node symlink once the device is visible from
sysfs.
You proposed to create the DT node earlier, DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_EARLY() instead
of DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_FINAL() in order to have it set before the device_add()
call.
This raised some new issues because the DT node creation needs some information
set by the PCI core. DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER() was the new candidate.
Issues were still present.
The 'ranges' property is needed and information needed for its computation
are set by the PCI core after the device_add() call.

At this point the discussion continued also on interrupts with the idea to
add the 'interrupt-controller' property in the PCI device node in order to
bypass all the interrupt mapping done in DT nodes.
Indeed, in order to have a working DT mapping, an 'interrupt-parent' phandle
is needed at some points and will be problematic with ACPI.

On my side I've got a piece of code to consider the PCI device as an interrup
controller. This work with the 'interrupt-controller' property.

The question raised:
Which part of code set the interrupt-controller property ?
- DT node creation:
  Common to all PCI devices even if the interrupt are not handled by the PCI
  device driver. Also '#interrupt-cells' is really device specific.
- Added by the PCI device driver itself
  Seems the good place but we enter in overlay memleak issues

What is your opinion related to the best candidate for the
'interrupt-controller' and '#interrupt-cells' property creation ?

Back to the of_node link addition to sysfs.
Is it really an issue to add it on an already present device ?
If so, is it acceptable (not tested on my side) to create the of_node link
to an empty node before the device_add() call and then fill this node later
when needed information are set by the PCI core ?

With your answers, I hope to move forward on these topics.
Best regards,
Hervé

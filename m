Agreed. I will try to send patches soon implementing option (2) above,
basically removing unified flushing. I will try to document any
potential regressions that may happen and how we may fix them. Ideally
we see no regressions.

Right. Also in the case of a mutex, if we disable preemption while
holding the mutex, this makes sure that whoever holding the mutex does
not starve waiters. Essentially the difference would be that waiters
will sleep with the mutex instead of spinning, but the mutex holder
itself wouldn't sleep.

I will make this a separate patch, just in case it's too
controversial. Switching the spinlock to a mutex should not block
removing unified flushing.

Yeah that's what I am trying to do here as well.  I will try to follow
up on this discussion with patches soon.

Thanks everyone!

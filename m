I think what you are looking for is that anything behind a PCIe tunnel
should not have this applied. IIRC the AMD GPU or some code there were
going to add identification of "virtual" links to the bandwidth
calculation functionality.

@Mario, do you remember if this was done already and if that could maybe
be re-used here?

The other way I think is something like this:

  - If it does not have "usb4-host-interface" property (or behind a port
    that has that). These are all tunneled (e.g virtual).

  - It is directly connected to a PCIe root port with
    "ExternalFacingPort" and it has sibling device that is "Thunderbolt
    NHI". This is because you can only have "NHI" on a host router
    according to the USB4 spec.

I may be forgetting something though.

I beleve that Mike alludes to what I have pointed in other email:
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/ZRrI90KcRBwVZn/r@dhcp22.suse.cz and a situation
when the hugetlb requests results in an acutal hugetlb allocation rather
than consumption from the pre-allocated pool. In that case memcg is not
involved because the charge happens only after the allocation happens.
That btw. means that this request could disrupt a different memcg even
if the current one is at the limit or it could be reclaimed instead.

Also there is not OOM as hugetlb pages are costly requests and we do not
invoke the oom killer.

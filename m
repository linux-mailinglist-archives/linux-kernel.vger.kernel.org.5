Like I wrote, how it will be implemented is still being
discussed.  But I think we all agree it makes sense to have a
single database for KernelCI with an API to access it.  For
example, the new API could be directly based on the KCIDB schema
etc. or KCIDB could become a translation layer on top of the new
API.  Or something else could happen a bit later.  But that
doesn't matter as far as this discussion about regressions is
concerned, there should eventually be a single source of data for
regressions collected by KernelCI and that will be shared by what
we currently refer to as the new API and KCIDB.

KernelCI is not any CI, it's designed to be the main system for
the upstream kernel.  So it already took the high-level approach
to look at all this after becoming an LF project and we came up
with KCIDB and now the new API as the community still needs
an "active" system and not just a database for collecting data
from other systems.

Right, except you might hit another deprecation hurdle if we
start changing how things are designed around KCIDB and the new
API.  There's no doubt KCIDB will be supported for a long time,
but taking into considerations all the new developments can save
you a lot of trouble.

Sure, these things are important too.  I just wanted to say
they're not regressions per se.  There are lots of other things
that can be done to report issues to "lab" owners or anyone in
charge or test infrastructure.  It's just a different category.

We don't have such insight right now, as I explained earlier.
However, this means you could also play a role in shaping things
up based on your findings so far.  Everyone is welcome to join
the discussion.  It has been informal chats in weekly video calls
so far but we should start keeping track of things in a more
formal way soon.

My point here is that KernelCI started tackling this issue of
reporting kernel bugs several years ago at a very high level and
we've come up with some carefully engineered solutions for it, so
it looks like you're walking in our footsteps now.  The new web
dashboard, new API & Pipeline and KCIDB which pioneered working
outside the native realm of KernelCI provide some answers to the
challenges you're currently investigating.  So maybe it is
actually the best strategy for you to carry on doing things
independently, but it would seem to me like due diligence for
each of us to know what others are doing.  This email thread
contributes to it, and I can only thank you for starting it and
encourage more communication of this kind.

Thanks,
Guillaume

Could you expand some more on how this _helps_ memory.low? The
hugetlb memory is not reclaimable so whatever portion of its memcg
consumption will be "protected from the reclaim". Consider this
	      parent
	/		\
       A		 B
       low=50%		 low=0
       current=40%	 current=60%

We have an external memory pressure and the reclaim should prefer B as A
is under its low limit, correct? But now consider that the predominant
consumption of B is hugetlb which would mean the memory reclaim cannot
do much for B and so the A's protection might be breached.

As an admin (or a tool) you need to know about hugetlb as a potential
contributor to this behavior (sure mlocked memory would behave the same
but mlock rarely consumes huge amount of memory in my experience).
Without the accounting there might not be any external pressure in the
first place. 

All that being said, I do not see how adding hugetlb into accounting
makes low, min limits management any easier.

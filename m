If the Thunderbolt host controller is a discrete chip attached with PCIe,
the bandwidth is capped by its Switch Upstream Port.

E.g. the "Light Ridge" Thunderbolt 1 controller's Switch Upstream Port
supports 5 GT/s at x4 width.

In contemporary systems, the Thunderbolt controller is often part of the
CPU SoC, so attached Thunderbolt devices appear below a Root Port.
In that case, there's no such limitation.

Additionally the bandwidth is limited by the Thunderbolt generation:
Thunderbolt 1 had two bidirectional 10 GBit/s channels,
Thunderbolt 2 has 20 GBit/s total, Thunderbolt 3 & 4 has 40 GBit/s total:

Hence assuming "unlimited" capacity for Thunderbolt wouldn't be accurate.

Thanks,

Lukas

Thanks, and understood.  In this case the request from Igor was 

    can you test this series on affected machine with broken kernel to see if
    it's of any help in your case?

The latest vanilla kernel (6.7) has (AFAIK) had the offending commit
reverted, so it's not a "broken" kernel in this respect.  Therefore, if I've
understood the request correctly, working with that kernel won't produce the
desired test.

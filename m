You are not correct here. The examples from
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/dsa/marvell.txt don't have ports,
and the way in which you added the ports is wrong (at least relative to
the way in which you kept the mdio node).

Ok, the warning is valid, but I don't know what phy-mode to put there.
It is unrelated anyway. Some warnings will be expected after the schema
conversion, and they are not all mechanical to fix. When we put schema
validation in place for checking that CPU ports have valid link
descriptions that phylink can use, we decided to be lax in the kernel,
but strict in the dt-schema. Hmm, not sure what were we thinking.
We didn't have a schema for Marvell, so we weren't even seeing many of
the validation errors that you're now uncovering.

You can use https://elixir.bootlin.com/u-boot/latest/source/arch/arm/dts/imx6qdl-gw5904.dtsi#L211
(optionally renaming switch to ethernet-switch, and ports to ethernet-ports).
That uses the subset of the mv88e6xxx kernel bindings that U-Boot also
understands, so taking a U-Boot example is actually preferable.

Yes, for most of the switches, renaming their OF nodes should not be a problem.

For Marvell, I'd exercise extra caution and only rename those OF nodes
where I can confirm that doing so won't break anything. Marvell is one
of the oldest DSA drivers, and you can tell that the bindings have gone
through a lot before becoming more or less uniform.

Anyway, for the $nodename constraint, it _looks_ all mechanical and trivial
to fix (unlike the missing phy-mode that you point to, above), so someone
will jump to fix it. I would like to avoid that, because boot testing
will be key, and a board is not always available.

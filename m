This is definitely worth investigating further before resorting to
proposing a new interface. If the kswapd consumes CPU cycles
unproductively then we should look into why.

If there is a big peak memory demand then that surely requires CPU
capacity for the memory reclaim. The work has to be done, whether that
is in kswapd or the pro-active reclaimer context. I can imagine the
latter one could be invoked with a better timing in mind but that is not
a trivial thing to do. There are examples where this could be driven by
PSI feedback loop but from what you have mention earlier you are doing a
idle time based reclaim. Anyway, this is mostly a tuning related
discussion. I wanted to learn more about what you are trying to achieve
and so far it seems to me you are trying to workaround some issues and
a) we would like to learn about those issues and b) a new interface is
unlikely a good fit to paper over a suboptimal behavior.

Hmm, OK it seems that we are hitting some terminology problems. The
discussion was about private memory so far (essentially MAP_PRIVATE)
now you are talking about a shared anonymous memory. That would imply
shmem and that is indeed not supported by MADV_PAGEOUT. The reason for
that is that this poses a security risk for time based attacks. I can
imagine, though, that we could extend the behavior to support shared
mappings if they do not cross a security boundary (e.g. mapped by the
same user). This would require some analysis though.

Just adding an adding configuration option means user interface contract
that needs to be maintained for ever. Our future reclaim algorithm migh
change (and in fact it has already changed quite a bit with MGLRU) and
explicit request for LRU type specific reclaim might not even have any
sense. See that point?

Which was v3.8-rc1 afaics.

Let me do that:

#regzbot inconclusive: regression from the 3.8 days, tracking doesn't
really gain us anything

To explain: not sure how Linus sees it, but if the culprit was merged
that long ago there is not much worth in tracking it, as there is no
easy way to fix it with a revert or something anyway. Sure, the issue
nevertheless should not remain unfixed, but lets trust Ted here that
he'll sooner or later take care of it when he sees fit.

Ciao, Thorsten

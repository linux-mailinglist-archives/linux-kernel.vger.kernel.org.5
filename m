There are 2 problems with your proposal, as I see it;

1) the core-mm is not enlightened for CONTPTE mappings. As far as it is
concerned, its just mapping a bunch of PTEs. So it has no hook to inc/dec
entire_mapcount. The arch code is opportunistically and *transparently* managing
the CONT_PTE bit.

2) There is nothing to say a folio isn't *bigger* than the contpte block; it may
be 128K and be mapped with 2 contpte blocks. Or even a PTE-mapped THP (2M) and
be mapped with 32 contpte blocks. So you can't say it is entirely mapped
unless/until ALL of those blocks are set up. And then of course each block could
be unmapped unatomically.

For the PMD case there are actually 2 properties that allow using the
entire_mapcount optimization; It's atomically mapped/unmapped through the PMD
and we know that the folio is exactly PMD sized (since it must be at least PMD
sized to be able to map it with the PMD, and we don't allocate THPs any bigger
than PMD size). So one PMD map or unmap operation corresponds to exactly one
*entire* map or unmap. That is not true when we are PTE mapping.

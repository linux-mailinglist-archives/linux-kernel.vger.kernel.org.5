What if a system have multiple non VGA-compatible GPU while all of them can display?
We still need to select a default for for user-space executable program (X server).

What if the VGA goes away someday?
I means that hardware vendors may abandon the old VGA standard.
After all, snooping a fixed address aperture is not absolute necessary for modern graphic card.
Modern graphic have dedicated VRAM Bar, the occupied address range can be relocatable.
Thus avoid the address overlap (or occlusion).

Yes, there do exist some PCI*NON*  VGA-compatible display controllers,
Strictly speaking, there are not VGA-compatible in the sense that
they don't respond the fixed legacy VGA aperture.
Such a display controller also don't cares about the extension ROM (option ROM).
Loongson display controllers are one of the various examples.

Besides, Intel integrate GPU is capable switch to*NON*  VGA-compatible.
especially in a multiple GPU co-exist hardware environment.
Old BIOS of Intel platform will change its class code from 0x0300 to 0x0380.
Newer BIOS do allow us to choose which one should be the primary GPU,
but if a user don't choose the Intel integrate GPU as primary,
the BIOS still will alter its PCI class code from 0x0300 to 0x0380.


By listing examples as above, I means that a PCI(e) GPU device do not
need to be VGA-compatible to display something on screen.
This is a very important point, I think,
which lead me to consider expand vgaarb.

I'm not sure if we should handle the programming interface thing here,
there are a lot of places where just ignore the programming interface.

Also, I have another thought for this question.
The vga_set_default_device() function interface exported by vgaarb
is not ensure the restriction either.
I means that it does not check if a device is VGA-compatible,
it does not examine if the programming interface is 00000000b or 00000001b either.
In theory, a programmer could set a display device via the vga_set_default_device() interface.
Maybe this function is intentionally leave some space to workaround.

So, my idea is that leave programming interface related problems to the future.
I don't want to worry about a non-exist thing(programming interface == 0x01 for an example).


Back to my patch set, is this patch acceptable?
Or I still need to refine this series?
My other patches are queued up with this.

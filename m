That can very well be the case because we may be in a state where some
cpus are flushed and some aren't. Also sometimes a few seconds is too
old. We have some workloads that read the stats every 1-2 seconds to
keep a fresh state, and they certainly do not expect stats to be 2+
seconds old when they read them.

Everyone used to pay this price though and no one used to complain.
Even before rstat, we used to iterate the entire hierarchy when
userspace reads the stats. rstat came in and made this much more
efficient by only iterating the subtrees that actually have updates.

The "skip if someone else is flushing" behavior was introduced for
flushers in critical paths (e.g. refault), and hurting the accuracy
for userspace readers was a side effect of it. This patch is trying to
remedy this side effect by restoring the old behavior for userspace
reads.

One other side effect is testing. Some tests started becoming flaky
because a test performs an action and expects the state of the system
to change in a certain way deterministically. In some cases the
flushing race leads to false negatives.

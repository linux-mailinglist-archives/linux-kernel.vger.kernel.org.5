ACPI TPM table entry, available without TPM drivers.

TPM PCR bios measurement, available only with working TPM drivers.

As I understand, there are two questions which systemd and userspace need aswers to:

1) is there a TPM device

2) was a TPM device used by firmware to measure boot

If answer to 1) is yes, then drivers need to be loaded, but not necessarily
in early boot before main rootfs mount. If answer to 2) is yes, then
drivers and userspace components should be setup for TPM in early boot.

The x86 and server grade arm standard for 1) is ACPI table TPM entry, basically
/sys/firmware/acpi/tables/TPM2. For other HW, like embedded arm boards/SoCs,
the TPM device can be on discoverable bus (optee firmware TPM etc)
or in devicetree. These work correctly with udev etc and drivers get loaded
in normal boot and thus answer 1).

For 2), once kernel side TPM device has been initialized, driver built into the
kernel or loaded before this check, userspace and systemd can check if
/sys/firmware/acpi/tables/TPM2 is there, or alternatively if TPM driver
is already working /sys/kernel/security/tpm0/binary_bios_measurements
which indicates that firmware was measured with TPM. The latter really requires
built in TPM drivers or modules which are loaded really early in boot, almost
as first thing in userspace, before systemd does any checks for the TPM
device existance. These steps happen in initramfs so that TPM can be used
to protect main rootfs. systemd implements this with efi_has_tpm2()
function in https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/src/shared/efi-api.c#L482

One problem is how to support TPM devices as kernel modules. Linux distros
should be able to build these drivers too as modules and systemd etc will
take care to load them once devices are discovered, and then queue in
other possibly complex userspace services/daemons so that TPM is useful and
rootfs can be decrypted. /sys/kernel/security/tpm0/binary_bios_measurements is
available only when the TPM driver is loaded and working. For example, if boot firmware has
optee and firmware TPM (fTPM) as an early trusted application (early TA), then this
only works when optee driver is initialized, tee-supplicant userspace daemon runs
and tpm_ftpm_tee kernel driver for fTPM has been loaded to the kernel. tee-supplicant
implements RPMB storage if board/HW does not support it directly. The optee and fTPM
kernel drivers can be built into kernel, but they still need tee-supplicant in
userspace.

To answer 2), ACPI TPM table entry works without kernel drivers, but what
about devices without ACPI support, or TPM on a discoverable bus like optee with fTPM?

Parsing devicetree in userspace is really painful, but could possible be done.
Or kernel could provide a sysfs indicator if there is a devicetree entry
for TPM. But there are some devices where devicetree does not show a TPM
device but one exists in the discoverable bus, optee fTPM.

In all, granted limited, arm64 cases which I have seen, when firmare was aware
of the TPM device and used it for measuring boot, then the TPM Event Log was
provided to the kernel. The early boot log messages like show this:

arm64 qemu with swtpm, u-boot based EFI firmware, TPM Event Log and TPM

Some of these TPM indicators could be considered firmware bugs, but in all
cases TPM firmware support can be detected via TPM Event Log
so that answers question 2).

TPM Event Log is not a random firmware interface. It is an optional interface
to make TPM usable and in practice most TPM using firmware provide it to the kernel.
The actual measurement and checks for it require the TPM HW and measurement PCRs,
but the TPM Event Log is a strong indicator from firmware to the kernel, and userspace,
that TPM is available and was used.

Kernel already knows about TPM Event Log. The proper interface to read it is from
securityfs file binary_bios_measurements implemented by loaded TPM driver.
Existence of this measurement is know before TPM driver is loaded and this change
only exports that to sysfs so that userspace can queue the TPM driver loading
and userspace services/daemons in the early initramfs before main rootfs is available.

Hope this helps,

IIUC the AER IRQ is the important thing.

Neither 015c9cbcf0ad nor this patch affects logging in
PCI_ERR_COR_STATUS, so the lspci output won't change and mentioning it
here doesn't add useful information.

I'd suggest more specific wording than "spamming `lspci -vv`", e.g.,

  015c9cbcf0ad ("mmc: sdhci-pci-gli: GL9750: Mask the replay timer
  timeout of AER") masks Replay Timer Timeout errors at the GL975x
  Endpoint.  When the Endpoint detects these errors, it still logs
  them in its PCI_ERR_COR_STATUS, but masking prevents it from sending
  ERR_COR messages upstream.

  The Downstream Port leading to a GL975x Endpoint is unaffected by
  015c9cbcf0ad.  Previously, when that Port detected a Replay Timer
  Timeout, it sent an ERR_COR message upstream, which eventually
  caused an AER IRQ, which prevented the system from suspending.

  Mask Replay Timer Timeout errors at the Downstream Port.  The errors
  will still be logged in PCI_ERR_COR_STATUS, but no ERR_COR will be
  sent.

*Could* 015c9cbcf0ad have used the generic PCI_ERR_COR_MASK to
accomplish the same effect?  Is there an advantage to using the
device-specific PCI_GLI_9750_CORRERR_MASK?

If masking via PCI_ERR_COR_MASK would work, that would be much better
because the PCI core can see, manage, and make that visible, e.g., via
sysfs.  The core doesn't do that today, but people are working on it.

Did you mean "PCI_ERR_COR_REP_TIMER is already masked *by*
015c9cbcf0ad"?

If masking PCI_ERR_COR_REP_TIMER using the generic PCI_ERR_COR_MASK in
the GL975x would have the same effect as masking it with
PCI_GLI_9750_CORRERR_MASK, then I think you should *only* use the
generic PCI_ERR_COR_MASK.

No need to do both if the generic one is sufficient.  And I think both
should be done in the same place since they're basically solving the
same problem, just at both ends of the link.

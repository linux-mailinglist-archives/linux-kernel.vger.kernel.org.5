The requirement that the OS request AER control whenever it requests
DPC control is mentioned in both sec 4.5.1 and sec 4.5.2.4.  IMO sec
4.5.2.4 should not exist because the per-bit table in sec 4.5.1 is a
better place for implementation guidance.  4.5.2.4 is easy to miss,
mostly redundant, and hard to integrate with the 4.5.1 table.

What advantage do you see for citing 4.5.2.4 instead of 4.5.1?  The
only real difference I see is that it also points out a firmware
problem.  I don't think the extra text is worth it since it doesn't
motivate the Linux change.

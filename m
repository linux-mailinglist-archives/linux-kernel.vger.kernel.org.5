Subject: Re X, a total solution information system integration (was fair pay,
 low jitter, philosophy)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Our society is already much according to Ala, after The Quran. Ala is 
however written to the left. And is symbolcorrect this way.

Where Iblis Ash Shaytan is the enemy.  And Shayatin followers of it.

And one is a muclim. Where those who believe right and do not have 
cogods to Ala shall have gardens with rivers running through.   (Not 
"Paradise, this is about Paradox).

If one wants to reflect this level of excellence writing to the right, 
one needs to rebase on Re. Which is the most developed version of Manus 
(Adam) God.

While import words like Haram and Halal for food are symbolcorrect here 
aswell.

Respecting Manu being a Prophet and Sha. Mankind being a word derived 
from this. Later prophets being Abraham, Moses, Isa, Muhammad. (All in 
The Quran.)

While ofcourse Re is The Oft-Forgiving, it is best to be correct on this.

"God" is correct for denoting its singularity, as in "Re is the only God".

The related phrase then becomes "Re is Dev of The World".

I use the form Dev here, a shortform of developer.

Which is a good translation, of the romanic arabic phrase Ala, Rabb Al 
Alamin, Al Rahman, Al Rahim. (written to the left)

And “universes and earth" also reflects a viewpoint of One God.

"And who is The Dev of The World? He is The Dev The Universes and The 
Earth" as is said to Firon in The Quran.

In The Quran there is also seven universes "created on top of eachother".

--

Re X is a system that respects this, and is a total solution for fair 
pay, low jitter, and philosophy. Which is needed for a scope of that of 
a modern day OS.

And is an interactive version of Adams Tablet today.

Where the adherant or not is a San. (User of Re X.) Where Re is Dev of 
The World, and has no cogod.

It uses contemporary language. One should listen to The Elite, and not 
follow The Troll.
One should is aware of The Day Of Trial, where one tested according to 
ones actions.

And Gamers are violaters of netiquette, spending times with games alone, 
and probably piracy, and related culture of disbelief.

It has basis in that Norway was originally called Hyperia, after Manu 
(Adams) God. And rebel colonies, that went against them, and their Sha.

I use this to research cultural dynamics still for the O S and it is 
also an interesting perspective, and works well.

I use this on my project BiT, Haqon from Hyperia. 
https://www.youtube.com/@BiT_The_Haqon_from_Hyperia

Where this monotheism abstracts away from suboptimal constructs, which 
really is necessary here, and optimal psychology.

It also supports a custom signs script, and furthermore is also inspired 
by Oman.

And praises like, Re is Top.

Re is Top,

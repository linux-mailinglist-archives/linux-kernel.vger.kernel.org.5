No. I think we are overly complicating it by doing this. IMHO we don't need
fex_end and pa_end at all here. With fex_end, pa_end, we are passing pointers,
updating it's members before and after sending it to these functions,
dereferencing them within those helpers.

e.g. with your change it will look like 
<snip>
		struct ext4_free_extent ex = {
			.fe_logical = ac->ac_g_ex.fe_logical;
			.fe_len = ac->ac_orig_goal_len;
		}

        loff_t orig_goal_end = fex_end(sbi, &ex);
		ex.fe_len = ac->ac_b_ex.fe_len;
		ex.fe_logical = orig_goal_end - EXT4_C2B(sbi, ex.fe_len);
		if (ac->ac_o_ex.fe_logical >= ex.fe_logical)
			goto adjust_bex;
</snip>

In above snip we introduced ex variable, updated it with
orig_goal_len, then called fex_end() to get orig_goal_end, then we again
updated ex.fe_len, but this time we didn't call fex_end instead we
needed it for getting ex.fe_logical. All of this is not needed at all. 

e.g. we should use just use (loff_t) wherever it was missed in the code.
<snip>
		ext4_lblk_t new_bex_start;
		loff_t new_bex_end;

		new_bex_end = (loff_t)ac->ac_g_ex.fe_logical +
			EXT4_C2B(sbi, ac->ac_orig_goal_len);
		new_bex_start = new_bex_end - EXT4_C2B(sbi, ac->ac_b_ex.fe_len);
		if (ac->ac_o_ex.fe_logical >= new_bex_start)
			goto adjust_bex;
</snip>


In this we just update (loff_t) and it reads better in my opinion then
using ex, fex_end() etc.

In my opinion we should simply drop the helpers. It should be obvious
that while calculating logical end block for an inode in ext4 by doing
lstart + len, we should use loff_t.
Since it can be 1 more than the last block which a u32 can hold.
So wherever such calculations are made we should ensure the data
type of left hand operand should be loff_t and we should typecast the
right hand side operands such that there should not be any overflow
happening. We do at several places in ext4 already (also while doing
left-shifting (loff_t)map.m_lblk).

Doing this with helpers, IMO is not useful as we also saw above.

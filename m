Huacai, is your concern that the gdb user might have created a script
(for example, printing a variable or two, then automatically continuing),
so that breakpoints could happen in quick successsion, such that the
second breakpoint might run concurrently with rcu_gp_fqs()?

If this can really happen, the point that Joel makes is a good one, namely
that rcu_gp_fqs() is single-threaded and (absent rcutorture) runs only
once every few jiffies.  And gdb breakpoints, even with scripting, should
also be rather rare.  So if this is an issue, a global lock should do the
trick, perhaps even one of the existing locks in the rcu_state structure.
The result should then be just as performant/scalable and a lot simpler
than use of atomics.

Either way, testing would of course be very good!  ;-)

							Thanx, Paul

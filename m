A few runs on mm-unstable with this patch:

# time cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cg*/memory.stat > /dev/null
real 0m0.020s
user 0m0.005s
sys 0m0.015s

# time cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cg*/memory.stat > /dev/null
real 0m0.017s
user 0m0.005s
sys 0m0.012s

# time cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cg*/memory.stat > /dev/null
real 0m0.016s
user 0m0.004s
sys 0m0.012s

A few runs on mm-unstable with the patch reverted:

# time cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cg*/memory.stat > /dev/null
real 0m0.020s
user 0m0.005s
sys 0m0.015s

# time cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cg*/memory.stat > /dev/null
real 0m0.016s
user 0m0.004s
sys 0m0.012s

# time cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cg*/memory.stat > /dev/null
real 0m0.017s
user 0m0.005s
sys 0m0.012s

It looks like there are no regressions on cgroup v2 when reading the
stats. Please let me know if you want me to send a new version with
the cgroup v2 results as well in the commit log -- or I can just send
a new commit log. Whatever is easier for Andrew.

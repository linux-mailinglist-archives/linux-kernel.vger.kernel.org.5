Note that by Windows-crippled, I mean x86 PCs built by OEMs who care
about nothing other than the Windows logo sticker. These PCs often don't
allow secure boot keys to be modified by the owner of the machine, or
secure boot to be disabled at all. This is why shim exists, not because
UEFI secure boot is broken by design.

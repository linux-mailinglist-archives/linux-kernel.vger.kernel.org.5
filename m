I don't think this is the case. As far as I can see, VM_UFFD_MINOR only applies
to shmem and hugetlb. VM_UFFD_MISSING is checked under the PTL and if set on the
VMA, then it is handled without mapping the folio that was just allocated:

	/* Deliver the page fault to userland, check inside PT lock */
	if (userfaultfd_missing(vma)) {
		pte_unmap_unlock(vmf->pte, vmf->ptl);
		folio_put(folio);
		return handle_userfault(vmf, VM_UFFD_MISSING);
	}

So we are racing to allocate a large folio; if the vma later turns out to have
MISSING handling registered, we drop the folio and handle it, else we map the
large folio.

The vmf_orig_pte_uffd_wp() *is* required because we need to individually check
each PTE for the uffd_wp bit and fix it up.

So I think the code is correct, but perhaps it is safer/simpler to always avoid
allocating a large folio if the vma is registered for uffd in the way you
suggest? I don't know enough about uffd to form a strong opinion either way.

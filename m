I agree, that would be nice, but the whole point of the APEI/GHES
functionality is vendor value-add, so I'm not sure we can achieve that
ideal.

This is only true for the APEI/GHES path, right?  For *native* AER
handling, we attempt recovery for both fatal and non-fatal errors.

I naively expect that by PCIe protocol, corrupted DLLPs or TLPs
detected by CRC, sequence number errors, etc, would be discarded
before corrupting memory, so I doubt we'd get an uncorrectable error
that means "sorry, I just corrupted your data."

But DPC is advertised as "avoiding the potential spread of any data
corruption," so there must be some mechanisms of corruption, and since
DPC is triggered by either ERR_FATAL or ERR_NONFATAL, I guess maybe
the errors could tell us something.  I'm going to quit speculating
because I obviously don't know enough about this area.

When doing the CRC, can you distinguish between corrupted data and
data that was not written because a DMA was only partially completed?

I'm guessing this error injection directly writes the AER status bit,
which would probably only test the reporting (sending an ERR_FATAL
message), AER interrupt generation, firmware or OS interrupt handling,
etc.

It probably would not actually generate a DLLP with a bad sequence
number, so it probably does not test the hardware behavior of
discarding the DLLP if the sequence number is bad.  Just my guess
though.

The platform decides whether to use CPER_SEV_FATAL, so we can't change
that.  We *could* change whether Linux panics when the platform says
an error is CPER_SEV_FATAL.  That happens in drivers/acpi, so it's
really up to Rafael.

Personally I would want to hear from vendors who use the APEI/GHES
path.  Poking around the web for logs that mention HEST and related
things, it looks like at least Dell, HP, and Lenovo use it.  And there
are drivers/acpi/apei commits from nxp.com, alibaba.com, amd.com,
arm.com huawei.com, etc., so some of them probably care, too.

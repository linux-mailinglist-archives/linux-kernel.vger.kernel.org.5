That's the point, we will add a extra 100ms after PERST# de-assert
in the patch-v3 according to Base Spec r6.0 - 6.6.1:
        msleep(100);
        gpiod_set_value_cansleep(pcie->reset_gpio, 0);

+       /* As the requirement in PCIe base spec r6.0, system must wait a
+        * minimum of 100 ms following exit from a Conventional Reset
+        * before sending a Configuration Request to the device.*/
+       msleep(100);
+
        if (starfive_pcie_host_wait_for_link(pcie))
                return -EIO;

Yeah. I had notes on that. But I seem to have lost them. I need to reproduce the
problems and analyze them again which is not trivial. So, I have been procrastinating.

I am also disappearing for the rest of this year. I will try to look at it in the
new year.

OK.

For now, I will implement something and send it out just for reference. We can revisit
this topic next year sometime.

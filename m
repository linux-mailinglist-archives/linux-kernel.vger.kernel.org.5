I wanted to discuss what do you think about it. As I wrote my motivation
was to understood and get rid of those warnings "dterror: no symbols
found" from bootloader when using DTB files from mainline kernel (as
opposite of the DTB files from rpi foundation). And fix for it was just
to generate DTB files from kernel via dtc's -@ parameter, same what are
doing those mentioned patches (but they describe different problem for
which is same fix). I thought that fixing those bootloader warnings is a
bugfix.

This has now been done:

A bug has been opened at bugzilla.kernel.org as requested.  The logs, kernel
configuration and the "lspci -tv" output (requested in a subsequent email)
have been added.  The logs and kernel configuration are from the kernel.org
5.15.139 kernel.  You have been added to the bug's CC.  The bug number is
218268:

  https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=218268

As mentioned, testing another kernel can only happen next Thursday.  If
you would like other tests done let me know and I'll do them at the same
time.  I have remote access to the machine, so it's possible to retrieve
information from it at any time.

Let me know if there's anything else I can do to assist.

Regards

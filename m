If by churn you mean they'd be changing a lot later, then yes.

But by churn you mean merging patches to serve a purpose that is yet to follow
up, then I think that is fine. I think other complex patches were staged in
pieces to help with both review and test process. And to speed things up.

I don't know how the maintainers manage in general tbh. But finding the time
for a smaller set of patches would be easier IMHO for everyone interested.

Assuming my understanding is correct that the first set of patches upto
splitting the scheduler context are more or less stable.

Yep!

I didn't mean you should do that :-) Meant they're actually completely
independent.

Hmm okay. I thought they're dependent; and I meant to potentially independent
parts that can be piecewise merged. But perhaps I'm overthinking the splitting
here :-)

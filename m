The context in which we discussed "auto" was for a future aspiration to
automatically determine the order that should be used for a given allocation to
balance perf vs internal fragmentation.

The case we are talking about here is completely different; I had a pre-existing
feature from previous versions of the series, which would allow the arch to
specify its preferred order (originally proposed by Yu, IIRC). In moving the
allocation size decision to user space, I felt that we still needed a mechanism
whereby the arch could express its preference. And "recommend" is what I came up
with.

All of the friction we are currently having is around this feature, I think?
Certainly all the links you provided in the other thread all point to
conversations skirting around it. How about I just drop it for this initial
patch set? Just let user space decide what sizes it wants (per David's interface
proposal)? I can see I'm trying to get a square peg into a round hole.

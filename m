The house keeping cpumasks are statically set up at boot time. The 
cpuset code will have an internal isolated_cpus cpumask that lists all 
the CPUs that are in isolated partitions. It will also expose it with a 
new cpuset_cpu_is_isolated() function. The code is currently in the 
cgroup tree and will be merged into the upcoming v6.8 kernel. As the new 
isolated_cpus mask can be changed at run time, some synchronization may 
be needed depending on how it is being used. So the cpumask itself will 
not be exported, new API can be provided to copy out the cpumask if needed.

Cheers,
Longman

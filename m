I figured it was a risk.

In fact it's an area where my instinct to honour console messages and my
instinct to get into the kernel as soon as possible after the decision
to invoke it has been made come into conflict.

In other words does it matter that the console buffers are not flushed
before entering kgdb? However having thought about it for a little while
(and knowing the console code tends to be written to be decently robust)
I can come to the view the flushing is best.

No real need.

I don't really like seeing kdb_printf() being called from here but
having reviewed a bit of console code I think we can might be able
to use the new infrastructure to make kdb_printf() a slightly less
hateful ;-).

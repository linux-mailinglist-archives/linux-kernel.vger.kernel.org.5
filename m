It's actually not an rstat regression. It's always been this costly.

Quick history:

We used to maintain *all* stats in per-cpu counters at the local
level. memory.stat reads would have to iterate and aggregate the
entire subtree every time. This was obviously very costly, so we added
batched upward propagation during stat updates to simplify reads:

Author: Johannes Weiner <hannes@cmpxchg.org>
Date:   Tue May 14 15:47:12 2019 -0700

    mm: memcontrol: fix recursive statistics correctness & scalabilty

However, that caused a regression in the stat write path, as the
upward propagation would bottleneck on the cachelines in the shared
parents. The fix for *that* re-introduced the per-cpu loops in the
local stat reads:

commit 815744d75152078cde5391fc1e3c2d4424323fb6
Author: Johannes Weiner <hannes@cmpxchg.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 13 15:55:46 2019 -0700

    mm: memcontrol: don't batch updates of local VM stats and events

So I wouldn't say it's a regression from rstat. Except for that short
period between the two commits above, the read side for local stats
was always expensive.

rstat promises a shot at finally fixing it, with less risk to the
write path.

But I want to be clear: this isn't a regression fix. It's a new
performance optimization for the deprecated cgroup1 code. And it comes
at the cost of higher memory footprint for both cgroup1 AND cgroup2.

If this causes a regression, we should revert it again. But let's try.

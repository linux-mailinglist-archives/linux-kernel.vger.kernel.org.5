I would have still preferred, the block and len arguments inside struct
ext4_mark_context, because that better explains the use and definition of
structure and it's prepare function.
However, since this is not any functionality change, I am fine if you
prefer the current design(as you mentioned above).
We can always discuss & change it later too :) 

Since otherwise the refactoring changes looks good to me.

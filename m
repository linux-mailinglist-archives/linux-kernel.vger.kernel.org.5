I think we need to rewind a tad.

My understanding is that this uses the Cadence macb driver.

In your original message, you said that the ethernet driver wasn't
being bound to the driver.

Since the ethernet driver is responsible for spotting the "mdio"
sub-node and creating the MDIO bus, if the driver isn't being
successfully bound, then the MDIO bus and the PHYs on the bus won't be
created, so you won't find them in /sys/bus/mdio_bus/devices.

Moreover, the Cadence macb driver, and this doesn't care about the
presence of the PHY at probe time, only when the network interface is
brought up. See macb_phylink_connect() which is called from
macb_open().

So, I think that the deferred probing has nothing to do with PHYs, and
that's just a wild goose chase.

I think instead we need to be concentrating on what's going on with
the ethernet driver, and why the ethernet driver is deferring its
probe. Is macb_probe() getting called at all? How far through
macb_probe() do we get before we defer?

I think those are the key questions that need answering.

Maybe, if you can get access to the machine while the driver is
deferring, /sys/kernel/debug/devices_deferred might give some
useful information, but that's just a hope.

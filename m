There is an alternative way of addressing this problem which doesn't
require using information regarding the previous trip point and so it
would work even if the trips were not sorted.

Namely, for each trip there can be an effective threshold equal to
either its temperature. or its temperature minus its hysteresis (low
temperature).  If the initial zone temperature is below the trip's
temperature, the initial value of its threshold is equal to its
temperature.  Otherwise, the initial value of the trip's threshold is
its low temperature.

Then, if the zone temperature crosses the threshold (either up or
down), the trip crossing triggers and the threshold value is flipped
(that is, if it was equal to the trip's temperature, it becomes its
low temperature or the other way around).  [Note that if the threshold
value is equal to the trip temperature, it can only be crossed on the
way up, because it means that the zone temperature was below it at one
point and has not grown above it since then.  Conversely, if the
threshold value is equal to the low temperature of the trip, it can
only be crossed on the way down, because it means that the zone
temperature was above the trip temperature at one point and it has not
fallen below the trip's low temperature since then.]

This should not be hard to implement AFAICS and it should also work in
the cases when one trip is located in the hysteresis range of another
one.

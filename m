No current x86 firmware does not use restricted permissions at all.
All memory is mapped with both writable and executable permissions,
except maybe the stack.

The x86 Linux kernel has been depending on this behavior too, up until
recently (fixes are in -rc now for the v6.6 release). Before this, it
would copy its own executable image around in memory.

So EFI based kexec will need to support this behavior if it targets
older x86 kernels, although I am skeptical that this is a useful
design goal.

I have been experimenting with running the EFI stub code in user space
all the way until ExitBootServices(). The same might work for UKI if
it is layered cleanly on top of the EFI APIs (rather than poking into
system registers or page tables under the hood).

How this would work with signed images etc is TBD but I quite like the
idea of running everything in user space and having a minimal
purgatory (or none at all) if we can simply populate the entire
address space while running unprivileged, and just branch to it in the
kexec() syscall. I imagine this being something like a userspace
helper that is signed/trusted itself, and gets invoked by the kernel
to run EFI images that are trusted and tagged as being executable
unprivileged.

Thanks for all your work here.

This is going to be a maintenance problem.  We typically use quirks to
work around hardware defects, e.g., a device that advertises a feature
that doesn't work per spec.

But I don't see where the defect is here.  And I doubt that this is
really a unique situation.  So it's likely that this will happen on
other systems, and we don't want to have to add quirks every time
another one shows up.

If this is a firmware defect, e.g., if this platform is using
"ExternalFacingPort" incorrectly, we can add a quirk to work around
that, too.  But I'm not sure that's the case.

Can you include a citation (spec name, revision, section) for this

Random nits: Capitalize spec terms like "PCI", "USB", "Root Port",
etc., consistently in English text.  Rewrap to fill 78 columns or so.
Add blank lines between paragraphs.  This applies to the commit log
(which should be wrapped to 75 to allow for "git log" indent) as well
as comments.

But honestly, I hope we can figure out a solution that doesn't require
a big comment like this.  Checking for random device IDs to deduce the
topology is not the way PCI is supposed to work.  PCI is designed to
be enumerable, so software can learn what it needs to know by
interrogating the hardware directly.

For cases where that's impossible, ACPI is supposed to fill the gaps,
e.g., with "ExternalFacingPort".  If this patch covers over a gap that
firmware doesn't handle yet, maybe we need to add some new firmware
interface.  If that's the case, we can add quirks for platforms that
don't have the new interface.  But we at least need a plan that
doesn't require quirks indefinitely.

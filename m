I guess there's only few variants of how cgexec is invoked right?

The first thing we need to do is what exact steps those variants
perform.

After that we an decide how to implement exactly those variants.

E.g. without knowing do we need to perform any syscalls or can
this all done through sysfs affects somewhat how to proceed.

Right now if I want to build e.g. image with BuildRoot I'd need
to patch the existing recipe to add new dependencies in order to
execute these tests, and probably do the same for every project
that can package selftests to image.

Jarkko, many thx for picking this up and submitting it to Linus, much
appreciated. Sorry again for prodding things, but I felt I had to. Hope
you didn't mind too much.

I guess it's best if that is done by somebody that cares about bugzilla
(I don't fall into that group[1]) and knows the official status.

But FWIW, I wonder what you actually want to see documented. From
https://lore.kernel.org/all/CVAC8VQPD3PK.1CBS5QTWDSS2C@suppilovahvero/
it sounds like you had trouble with Link:/Closes: tag and Reported-by.
From what I can see I don't think bugzilla.kernel.org needs special
documentation in that area:

 * just use Link:/Closes: to reports to public reports that might be
helpful later in case somebody wants to look at the backstory of a
commit, wherever those reports may be (lore, bugzilla.kernel.org,
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues,
https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/issues, ...)

 * use Reported-by: to give credit to anyone that deserves it, as it is
a nice way to say thx while motivate people to help again in the future.
That usually will include the initial reporter, but might also include
people that replied to a report from somebody else and helped
perceptible with debugging or fixing.

Ciao, Thorsten

[1] I only sometimes help people that report regressions to
bugzilla.kernel.org that otherwise would likely would fall through the
cracks (among others because many reports are never forwarded to the
proper developers otherwise).

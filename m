No, BPF is not an excuse for improving our OOM/allocation failure
reports. BPF/tracing are secondary tools; whenever we're logging
information about a problem we should strive to log enough information
to debug the issue.

We've got junk in there we don't need: as mentioned before, there's no
need to be dumping information on _every_ slab, we can pick the ones
using the most memory and show those.

Similarly for shrinkers, we're not going to be printing all of them -
the patchset picks the top 10 by objects and prints those. Could
probably be ~4, there's fewer shrinkers than slabs; also if we can get
shrinkers to report on memory owned in bytes, that will help too with
deciding what information is pertinent.

That's not a huge amount of information to be dumping, and to make it
easier to debug something that has historically been a major pain point.

There's a lot more that could be done to make our OOM reports more
readable and useful to non-mm developers. Unfortunately, any time
changing the show_mem report the immediate reaction seems to be "but
that will break my log parsing/change what I'm used to!"...

I think this sentence is truncated.

Will do in the next version, thanks.

Given the numbers I got with the patch, it doesn't seem like we are
paying a significant cost for the accuracy. Anyway, as you say, it's
not something that can not be changed. In fact, I have another
proposal that I am currently testing, please see my next response to
Johannes.

Yeah this should work for this specific use case, thanks.

Perhaps, it's full of heuristics anyway :)

Oh I am not saying the wait benefits their use case. I am saying when
the wait is implemented, we face the same problem (expensive flush of
the entire hierarchy), so we need to mitigate it anyway -- hence the
relevance to Cloudflare's use case.

Anyway, I have an alternative that I will propose shortly in response
to Johannes's reply.

Makes sense, thanks!

Oh, cool. I can confirm that gcc does indeed add the strlen call
(note I had to remove the "--size" param to nm, as the symbol is 
undefined and not shown otherwise)

I wonder if there is an easy way to check for which functions gcc/clang 
do this...

Cool.

Thanks, I'll see how to improve that too :)

I raised the limit and the issue persists.

Also I replaced all entries in the array with a constant "0" and the
issue also persists.
So it can't be a).

Funnily when I keep the explicit array initializers and set all values
to "0" then the tripping point is from 4 to 5 array elements, the same
as with the current code.

With a plain array initialization the tripping point is from 2 to 3
elements.

That also works.

The offending commit was a change from a manually unrolled loop to the
current code.
This code is a few months old but somehow the issue was only found now.

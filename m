But is there really an issue? The board may not be using USB power supply.
It may simply have a barrel jack, like Quartz64-A does. And it will still
create an issue if you make the new behavior "opt-out" via DT. You can make
it opt-in if you like.

Also in Pinephone case, you'll not really have a case where the battery has
< 2V not loaded. That's not going to happen. PMIC will shut off at 3V battery
voltage when loaded. It will not discharge further, and after shutoff battery
voltage will jump to 3.4V or so, and it will not drop below 2V after that, ever.
So the battery will pretty much always be detected as long as it's present.

What actual problem have you seen that this patch is trying to solve?

Thank you and kind regards,

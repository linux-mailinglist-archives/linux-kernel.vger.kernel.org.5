While I believe all of these are true, I think they are not reasons not to
have memcg accounting. As everyone has pointed out, memcg
accounting by itself cannot handle all situations - it is not a fix-all.
Other mechanisms, such as the HugeTLB controller, could be the better
solution in these cases, and hugetlb memcg accounting is definitely not
an attempt to infringe upon these control domains.

However, memcg accounting is still necessary for certain memory limits
enforcement to work cleanly and properly - such as the use cases we have
(as Johannes has beautifully described). It will certainly help
administrators simplify their control workflow a lot (assuming we do not
surprise them with this change - a new mount option to opt-in should
help with the transition).

Got it! I'll introduce some opt-in mechanisms in the next version. This is
my oversight.

I mean I haven't found the steps to submit v2 (and later) of a patch (as
v1 in https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Contributing).

For instance (as far as I learned, but sure there are mistakes):

   1. Create a new branch from the v1 branch branch:
          Run git checkout patch_v1
          Run git checkout -b patch_v2
   2. Modify the sources for version v2.
   3. Commit the modified files with -s to add Signed-off-by: Your name
          <your email> at end.
   4. Run make to build or whatever.
   5. Test your changes.
   6. If everything is fine,
      Run git format-patch --base=3Dauto --in-reply-to=3D[email id from
          patch_v1 (0/1 cover letter? or 1/1?)] [--cover-letter]? -o
          outgoing_v2/ master
      This will create three files (if you added --cover-letter
          parameter). I don't know if in patch's v2 is neccesary cover
          letter. The file starting by 0001- is patch's v1 (I am not
          sure if is necessary send patch's v1 or only link is enougth) and=
 file
          starting by 0002- is patch's v2. You need to edit these files
          and add version changes after --- line (they are only
          information won't be on commit) from version to version.

   7. Run your patches through the kernel's style checker in scripts/checkp=
atch.pl
   8. Run path/kernel/linux/scripts/get_maintainer.pl path/yourPatch_v2/out=
going_v2/0002-patchSubject.patch
   9. Run git send-email --to=3D"mailing list email" --cc=3D"[emails from s=
tep 8 separated by commas (if any)], [other emails you want to send patch v=
2 separated by commas]" outgoing_v2/

At this point you will have sent the v2 patch to the --to and --cc
emails. If you don't use git send-email, note that emails to be sent to
mailing lists must be in plain text
(https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/email-clients.html).

I don't know correct steps to send patch's v2 as above instance. Sorry,
but I need step by step instructions, if not I think that I can make
mistakes and I don't want. Sorry, but my experience says that is very
easy make mistakes when I am newbie.

No, I just want to know how an expert programmer will do the task that I
need to do. I can try it myself with trial/error, but I'm not alone, am I?

I apologize if I said anything that was confusing (English is not my
native tongue). My question was if expert developers create a different
name for outgoing directory for each patch's version on
git format-patch ... -o outgoing/ master command.
For instance: -o outgoing_v1 for v1, -o outgoing_v2 for v2 and so on.
I ask this because you can lost patch files from previous
patches if you run this command several times (it makes backup ending
with ~, but usually last backup is lost after update). Or not?

So I undertand that is not neccesary. Right?

I apologize if I said anything that was confusing (English is not my

I apologize if I said anything that was confusing (English is not my
native tongue). I wanted to say that I created new branch from branch
for patch v1 to run git reset or whatever without modify branch patch
v1. If I make any mistake or something harmful I can checkout to
original branch for patch v1 and delete this test branch.

I think that is secure. Right?

I apologize if I said anything that was confusing (English is not my
native tongue). I wanted to say that is not necessary send previous
patch v1 because I sent it before. For instance, if I send v20, is
necessary send 19 previous versions to mailing list? How usually is
managed? As format-patch do?, sending only last version with links to
previous versions? Sorry for my question, but I think that send again
the previous versions is not necessary and will saturate the mailing
list, but it is only my modest opinion, the important thing is how it is
usually done.

Yes if I am doing something for me, but send patch to e2fsprog or
whatever involve more people and I don't want make many mistakes and
disturb others (I know you are very busy).

I learned sometimes without manuals and is very hard. I don't mind if
my mistakes are private. For instance, if learning something in my PC I
made a big mistake is my problem and my time to solve it, but if I made
a big mistake sending patches I will feel very bad because I made lost
time to others.

Yes, I am interested in becoming a technical writer. I think I could be
a good technical writer because I want to explain everything thinking
that the people reading are newbies. Explain things in such a way that
no one has doubts. I know it is very difficult, but I like difficult
challenges. English is not my native language, so I will need someone
with English as a native language to verify my documentation.

I will surely make mistakes. I am only human.

This way I can improve my linux developer level and my English level, so
I would like (on my limited spare time).

I would like very much. I would need someone to clear up my doubts or
correct my contributions. I think it's a good way to help the community
that I'm so grateful for and at the same time I would learn a lot of new
things about Linux and how to be a kernel developer. I think it's the
best way to start and we'll see how far I can go. My wish is to become a
kernel developer, but if I'm not good enough, I'll learn a lot of new
things, which is good too.

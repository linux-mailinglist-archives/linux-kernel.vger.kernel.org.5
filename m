Thanks for explanation. I vote against /delete-property/ because it is
error-prone and a bit confusing. The same with overriding compatibles -
if possible, should be avoided. sc7180-trogdor-pazquel360.dtsi is doing
both, but that's not the pattern I find easy to read.

I accept overriding supplies or pins, because these differ per board.
But if common DTSI defines compatible, then it is common for everyone or
it is not really part of common DTSI.

IOW, the common DTSI should be more like a SoC DTSI - have only parts
present there. I simplify here, because obviously SoC is a real thing
piece of hardware and common board DTSI is not. It's just an
abstraction... but anyway if different boards use different codecs, then
I would say it is not part of common platform.

Best regards,
Krzysztof

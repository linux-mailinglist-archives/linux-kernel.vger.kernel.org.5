But all other walk_page_XX has been convertedï¼Œsee more from commit
49b0638502da "mm: enable page walking API to lock vmas during the walk"),
there's nothing special about this one, the calls must pass the right
page_walk_lock to mm_walk_ops,

or adding the above lock check into process_mm_walk_lock too.

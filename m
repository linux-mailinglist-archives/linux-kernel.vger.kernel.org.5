Yes, that's the reason. OTOH it's probably worth a try. The point is
that mapping a DMA buffer is allowed to fail, so callers should be
prepared anyway.

And for the case you reported initially, I don't think there is any need
to preserve bit 11 (0x800) from the original buffer's physical address,
which is enough to fix it. See also my other email earlier today.

My gut reaction when I became aware of this is to just eliminate it with
!cgroup_subsys_on_dfl(memory_cgrp_subsys) too :)

Yeah, let's just keep it simple + safe and disable it on cgroupv1 for now.
We can have this conversation again later in the future when someone
wants this in v1 (and yes, this conversation should include the option
of moving to v2).

Consider it yet another incentive to migrate to cgroupv2 ;)

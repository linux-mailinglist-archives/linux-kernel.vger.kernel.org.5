I'm not sure if either you haven't noticed the logic in anon_folio_order()
above, or whether you are making this suggestion because you disagree with the
subtle difference in my logic?

My logic is deliberately not calling hugepage_vma_check() because that would
return false for the thp=madvise,mmap=unhinted case, whereas the policy I'm
implementing wants to apply LAF in that case.


My intended policy:

                | never     | madvise   | always
----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------
no hint         | S         | LAF>S     | THP>LAF>S
MADV_HUGEPAGE   | S         | THP>LAF>S | THP>LAF>S
MADV_NOHUGEPAGE | S         | S         | S


What your suggestion would give:

                | never     | madvise   | always
----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------
no hint         | S         | S         | THP>LAF>S
MADV_HUGEPAGE   | S         | THP>LAF>S | THP>LAF>S
MADV_NOHUGEPAGE | S         | S         | S


Thanks,
Ryan

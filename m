What does "the OS can handle it appropriately" mean?  Whatever it
means, it sounds like a property of the OS, not a property of the
device.

I don't know what "D3cold works as in the spec" means, either.  The
spec says how D3cold affects internal device state, but it doesn't say
anything about how to put devices in D3cold or back in D0.

The longer this goes on the worse shape we are in because we're always
adding new special cases.

The fundamental problem I have is that "supports-d3" doesn't say
anything specific other than "current Linux can put the device in
D3hot or D3cold and get it back out again".  I think DT should tell us
characteristics of the device or the platform, e.g., "PMCSR doesn't
work to enter/leave D3hot on this device" or "regulator X controls
main power to the device to enter/leave D3cold".

But right now it sounds like a mixture of "PMCSR works correctly to
enter/leave D3hot" and "some unspecified software can control main
power to this device".

Putting devices in D3cold and back in D0 needs some kind of platform
support like ACPI methods or a native power management driver that
knows how to control power on a specific platform.  That's completely
different from D3hot, where the PCI spec tells us all we need to know.

My mental picture isn't detailed enough, so I'm still confused.  We're
talking about TLPs initiated by the RC.  Normally these would be
because a driver did a CPU load or store to a PCIe device MMIO space,
not to system memory.

But I guess you're suggesting the RC can initiate a TLP with a system
memory address?  And this TLP would be routed not to a Root Port or to
downstream devices, but it would instead be kind of a loopback and be
routed back up through the RC and maybe IOMMU, to system memory?

I would have expected accesses like this to be routed directly to
system memory without ever reaching the PCIe RC.

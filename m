Ok, I went back to it again.

I think trying to separate integrity metadata is premature now, too
many things at the same time.

I started to think, does EVM really need integrity metadata or it can
work without?

The fact is that CONFIG_IMA=n and CONFIG_EVM=y is allowed, so we have
the same problem now. What if we make IMA the one that manages
integrity metadata, so that we can remove the 'integrity' LSM?

So, no embedding the full structure in the security blob now, move
integrity_inode_free() and integrity_kernel_module_request() to IMA,
call integrity_iintcache_init() from IMA.

EVM verification of new files would fail without IMA, but it would be
the same now.

Also, evm_verifyxattr() would only work with IMA, as it assumes that
the latter creates integrity metadata and passes them as argument.

Regarding the LSM order, I would take Casey's suggestion of introducing
LSM_ORDER_REALLY_LAST, for EVM.

Thanks

Roberto

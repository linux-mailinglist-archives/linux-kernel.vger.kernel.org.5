Well, I have to admit that most lockdep splats I have dealt with
recently do not come with sysctl_hardlockup_all_cpu_backtrace so I
cannot really judge.

Think of distribution kernels that many people use. E.g SLES kernel uses
8k CONFIG_NR_CPUS

This is independent on the size of the machine if you are using
pre-built kernels.

this is certainly better than the original proposal

If the locked up cpu needs to be first is a real requirement (and this
seems debateable) then sure why not. I do not feel strongly to argue one
way or the other, maybe others have an opinion on that.

That sounds wrong.

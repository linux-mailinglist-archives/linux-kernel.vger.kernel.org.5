Yu, I never saw a reply to this. Have I managed to convince you? I'm willing to
put the vma param back into arch_wants_pte_order() and handle the policy in the
arch, if you consider that a less bad solution.

Zi, I think you are incorrect; Yu does not want order-0 to be the default. He's
just pointing out the that original "default return value that actually means
PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER" was 0 and that was not an ideal choice because 0
_could_ be a legitimate preference from the HW. So -1 is preferred for this
purpose. Yu - correct me if wrong!

Yes I have a real use case for my choice. But as I said above, I'm willing to
move that policy into the arch impl of arch_wants_pte_order() if its acceptable
to pass the vma in (this is how I was doing it in the original version, but
preference was to remove the parameter).

I would really rather avoid adding any knob for now if we possibly can. We have
discussed this in the past and concluded we should avoid. It was also raised
that if we do add a knob, then debugfs is not sufficient because you can't
access it in some environments.

Personally I don't think it makes much difference. "large folio" does not make
it clear that its for pte-mapped memory only. How about
arch_prefers_pte_order(), if it really must be changed?

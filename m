This issue has been encountered a few times in the context of eMMC 
devices. The vendor
has confirmed that only 512-byte atomicity can be ensured in the firmware.
Although the valid data is only 60 bytes, the entire commit block is 
used for calculating
the checksum.
jbd2_commit_block_csum_verify:
..
calculated = jbd2_chksum(j, j->j_csum_seed, buf, j->j_blocksize);
..

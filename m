Ha, yes, it does look like the LSM code uses the device name as
opposed to the major:minor format.  Given that existing use, and that
IPE is a LSM, sticking with 'dev=3D<name>' seems like the right thing to
do.  Sorry about that :/

Yes.  Failure to record the full hash digest string in the record
would be Very Bad, but for the sake of keeping the line lengths in the
docs and commit description reasonable you can trim as necessary.
After all, we all know what a full hash string looks like :)

Hmm.  Given the existing code, I guess stick with the untrusted string
variant for now.  I'm concerned that there is some device naming code
which might allow funky device names; although if you can prove that
is not the case then you can use the normal audit logging functions.

For reference, the characters that audit finds problematic can be
found in audit_string_contains_control().

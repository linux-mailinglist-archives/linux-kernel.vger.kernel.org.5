Yeah, I had the suspicion that this was really motivated by some
out-of-tree driver, which as I'm sure you know, is not a concern for
mainline.

Vendor drivers do all sorts of crazy stuff and we don't carry code in
mainline for the sole benefit of such drivers that have not been
upstreamed (and likely never will be).

So again, I think this patch should just be reverted.

If you want to get something like this in, you can send a follow-on
patch describing your actual motivation and use case. But as it appears
to boil down to "I need this for my out-of-tree driver", I suspect such
a patch would still be rejected.

Naive question, do mutexes handle thundering herd problems better than
spinlocks? I would assume so but I am not sure.

I agree, I was mainly concerned with the global flushing lock.

Unfortunately it cannot be broken down into per-cpu as all flushers
update the same per-cgroup counters, so we need a bigger locking
scope. Switching to atomics really hurts performance. Breaking down
the lock to be per-cgroup is doable, but since we need to lock both
the parent and the cgroup, flushing top-level cgroups (which I assume
is most common) will lock the root anyway.

All flushers right now operate in sleepable context, so we can go
again to the mutex if you think this will make things better. The
slowness problem reported recently is in a sleepable context, it's
just too slow for userspace if I understand correctly.

+Ivan Babrou

What I am thinking about now is that since all flushers are sleepable,
perhaps the thundering herd problem would be less severe, since we may
release the lock (or mutex) at the cpu boundaries. I wonder if would
be better if we retire the unified flushing on the memcg side, so that
not all flushers need to flush the entire tree, and we allow
concurrent flushing.

This should address the slowness in reads (as proven by a patch by
Ivan [1]), and it should also address the inaccuracy addressed by this
thread, since no flushers will skip if someone else is flushing.

I am trying to test if there are any regressions by running some
synthetic stress testing (reclaim, refault, read stats, repeat), so
far I can't see any.

Two things that we will need to figure out if we retire unified flushing:
(a) We now have a global "stats_flush_threshold" variable to know when
to flush and when to skip. If flushing is not global, we need to make
this per-cgroup or retire it as well. If we make it per-cgroup it may
affect the update-side, and we will need to move it to the rstat code
I think.

(b) We now have a global "flush_next_time" to know whether the
ratelimited flusher should run or not. If we keep it, only the global
async flusher will kill it forward, sync flushers will not. Otherwise
we can also make it per-cgroup and update it during flushes.

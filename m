Let me remind you that you are proposing a performance optimization and
such a change requires some numbers to actually show it is benefitial.
There are cases where the resulting code is clearly an improvement and
the performance benefit is just a nice side effect. I do not consider
this to be the case. The whole thing is quite convoluted even without
a better precision you are proposing. And let me be clear, I am not
opposing your patch but I would rather see it based on more than just
hand waving.

Well, don't get me wrong, I think the ability to create non repudiable
log entries from userspace is very useful.  However, I think the
proposed ABI is wrong: it should take the log entry (which will contain
the PCR number and the hash) then do the extension and add it to the
log so we get the non-repudiable verifiability.  This should work
equally with TPM and RTMR (and anything else).

The issue, I suppose, is what log format?  The TCG has one which is
extensible and IMA uses a similar but different binary log format.

There's a similar proposal for Keylime which was demo'd at Plumbers
last year, except it uses IMA to measure the container so you only have
to trust the kernel:

Just on this, lest we repeat the errors of the past (and believe me
there was a time people thought that simply extending TPM PCRs without
log entries was the way to do measurements), if you're extending a PCR
like entity you also need a log entry to tell people who come after you
what you've done.  Even in the one ephemeral VM per pod kata use case
(with RTMRs local to the VM), you'll still likely be starting several
sidecars and if you don't have a log to tell you the order you measured
the containers deriving the RTMR value is a combinatoric explosion.

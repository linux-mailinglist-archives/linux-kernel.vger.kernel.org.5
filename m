Thanks for the reivew. Since more improvement is needed, I would like to
define ext4_mark_context as you suggested in previous version:
    ext4_mark_context {
        ext4_group_t mc_group;          /* block group */
        ext4_grpblk_t mc_clblk;	    /* block in cluster units */
        ext4_grpblk_t mc_cllen;	    /* len in cluster units */
        ext4_grpblk_t mc_clupdates;     /* number of clusters marked/unmarked */
        unsigned int mc_flags;          /* flags ... */
        bool mc_state;                  /* to set or unset state */
    };
And super_block and handle are passed as arguments.

Besides, as we will pass a lot arguments in prepare function anyway. What
about simply passing all arguments to ext4_mb_prepare_mark_context
directly:
static inline void ext4_mb_mark_context(handle_t *handle,
                                                struct super_block *sb,
                                                int state,
                                                ext4_group_t group,
                                                ext4_grpblk_t blkoff,
                                                ext4_grpblk_t len,
                                                int flags,
                                                ext4_grpblk_t *changed)
Look forward to your reply. Thanks!

That has been a problem in the past, where a MII bus has been
registered by a driver, and then because its probe defers, the MII
bus gets torn down.

The "simple" solution to this is... try to avoid registering the MII
bus until you're sure that the probing will not defer. It is far from
perfect, since there's still the opportunity to unbind the driver
causing the MII bus to vanish along with the PHYs.

I have mentioned trying to address the issue of PHY drivers being
unbound in the past, and there's been some improvements with that,
but if the phy_device vanishes while something is using it, it
certainly will not end well. phylib is not the only case of this,
there are numerous instances of it. One of the recent ones that
I happened to be reminded of today is the pcs-rzn1-miic thing...
If you have a look at miic_create() and consider what would happen
if:

        if (!pdev || !platform_get_drvdata(pdev))
                return ERR_PTR(-EPROBE_DEFER);

 ... another thread ended up executing miic_remove() for this
    platform device at this very point ...

        miic_port = kzalloc(sizeof(*miic_port), GFP_KERNEL);
        if (!miic_port)
                return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);

        miic = platform_get_drvdata(pdev);
        device_link_add(dev, miic->dev, DL_FLAG_AUTOREMOVE_CONSUMER);

The devm allocation for "miic" would be freed, so either miic
ends up a stale pointer if it happened after this point, or
if miic_remove() completes, then platform_get_drvdata() returns
NULL and we oops the kernel here.

It's an unlikely race, but it's still a race. Sadly, the kernel
is getting riddled with things like this. I used to point these
things out, but having been shouted down many times I've given
up raising it.

Another example is the direct rendering manager bridge code
(drm_bridge).

I suggest a similar approach to not caring too much about this
for your own sanity... providing it doesn't actually cause a
problem!

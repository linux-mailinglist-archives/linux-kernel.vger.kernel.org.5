.. nope ... it is just as bad as my yaml-fu is :P ... but not sure if
vendors has also this needs or plain props will suffice...

ok

Basically yes it is discoverable, since at runtime the SCMI core, early on,
normally discovers the vendor_id/sub_vendor_id by querying the platform via
Base protocol and then later only loads/initializes (by closest match) the
vendor protocols that are present in the DT AND that has been 'tagged' at
compile time with the same vendor_id/sub_vendor_id tuple (in the vendor
module code, struct scmi_protocol)

Of course you should take care to put the proper protocol@81 node in your
vendor_A DTB for the vendor_A SCMI driver to make use of the additional
vendor_A properties that you have defined under your node as referred
in your vendor-protos.yaml...if you botch that up I will load a protocol
and call your vendor_A driver with a vendor_X DT node.

DT is currrently vendor-agnostic.

Oh, yes mine was just an ill example...one file per vendor will do just
fine: the important thing is that the list and the yaml itself can be
extended as new vendors appears (in a backward compatble way of course)

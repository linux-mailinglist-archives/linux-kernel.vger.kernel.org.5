Yep!

I believe what's happening here is one task unwinding another (starting from
whatever gets saved in switch_to()), and there's nothing that prevents that
other task from running concurrently and modifying/poisoning its stack. In
general trying to unwind a remote stack is racy and broken, but we're stuck
with a few bits of the kernel tryingto do that occasionally and so the arch
code needs to handle that without blowing up.

For KASAN specifically you'll need to access the stack with unchecked accesses
(e.g. using READ_ONCE_NOCHECK() to read the struct stackframe), and you'll
probably want to add some explicit checks that pointers are within stack bounds
since concurrent modification (or corruption) could result in entirely bogus
pointers.

I *think* that we do the right thing on arm64, so you might want to take a look
at arm64's unwinder in arch/arm64/kernel/stacktrace.c,
arch/arm64/include/asm/stacktrace.h, and
arch/arm64/include/asm/stacktrace/common.h.

Mark.

Agreed.

Yes, fully agreed on both points. The problem with zombies is real but
reparenting should address it for a large part. Ownership is a different
problem. We have discussed that at LSFMM this year and in the past as
well I believe. What we probably need is a concept of taking an
ownership of the memory (something like madvise(MADV_OWN, range) or
fadvise for fd based resources). This would allow the caller to take
ownership of the said resource (like memcg charge of it).

I understand that would require some changes to existing workloads.
Whatever the interface will be, it has to be explicit otherwise we
are hitting problems with unaccounted resources that are sitting without
any actual ownership and an undeterministic and time dependeing hopping
over owners. In other words, nobody should be able to drop
responsibility of any object while it is still consuming resources.

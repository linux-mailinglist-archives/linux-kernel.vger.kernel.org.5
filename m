TBH I am not really sure how complex that might turn out to be.
Swapcache tends to be full of subtle issues. So you might be right but
it would be better to know _why_ this is not possible before we end up
phising for couple of swapcache pages on potentially huge anon LRU to
isolate them. Think of TB sized machines in this context.

Got it. Bindings should be the same regardless of what driver would be used,
whether this OCM based one, or some future one based on the above mentioned
TCPCI in-kernel implementation. Hardware is the same in both cases.

Just trying to imagine how to actually solve the issues...

Basic thing with the I2C regulator thing is that needs to be enabled as long
as anx7688 needs to communicate over I2C. Other user of this power rail is
touchscreen controller for its normal power supply, and it needs to be able
to disable it during system suspend.

Now for things to not fail during suspend/resume based on PM callbacks
invocation order, anx7688 driver needs to enable this regulator too, as long
as it needs it.

I can put bus-supply to I2C controller node, and read it from the ANX7688 driver
I guess, by going up a DT node. Whether that's going to be acceptable, I don't
know. 


VCONN regulator I don't know where else to put either. It doesn't seem to belong
anywhere. It's not something directly connected to Type-C connector, so
not part of connector bindings, and there's nothing else I can see, other
than anx7688 device which needs it for core functionality.

ANX7688 chip desing doesn't have integrated VCONN mosfet switches so it always
needs external supply + switches that are controlled by the chip itself. There's
no sensible design where someone would not want this and the driver needs
to get this regulator reference from somewhere. The switches are sort of an
extension of the chip.

kind regards,
	o.

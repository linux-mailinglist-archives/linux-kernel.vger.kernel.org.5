I think that should be regarded as a bug in the driver that should be
fixed and this would not help with that case.  If a driver can't
initialize a device without aid from the pre-OS environment, that
should be fixed in the driver.  This solution also doesn't fix which
device is selected as the primary by the pre-OS environment.  That can
only be fixed in the pre-OS environment code.

The problem with adding modeset=3D10 is that it only helps when you have
one GPU driven by that driver in the system.  If you have multiple
GPUs driven by that driver, which one would that apply to?  E.g., what
if you have 2 AMD GPUs in the system.

It sounds like we need a general purpose "primary" selector.  I think
it's sort of orthogonal to VGA.  VGAARB is just for managing VGA
routing on PCI.  It's not really directly related to which GPU you
want to be the primary when the OS loads.  Maybe some new kernel
parameter, E.g., primary_display=3D<string> where the string would be
the specific device you wanted to be the primary,  E.g., you could use
the PCI BDF on PCI devices, primary_display=3D0000:0a:00.0 or some other
device string for non-PCI devices.

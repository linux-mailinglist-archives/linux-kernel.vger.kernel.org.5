Thanks, it gives a bit better clue.
The remaining question is rather the exact behavior of this
"unobtrusive mode".  How is it triggered, and what's the exact
expectation?  e.g. It must secretly mute the speaker?  That is, it
must not  expose the mixer state change to user-space?  Or is it tied
with the normal mixer state and user may unmute again?

In this firmware-first scenario, I'm assuming the platform retained
ownership of the AER capability, so I would think firmware certainly
should be allowed to clear PCI_ERR_UNCOR_STATUS.

It doesn't sound quite right to me for firmware to clear
PCI_SEC_STATUS because it doesn't own that register.  I suspect we
would probably see the "Received Master Abort" bit set after
enumeration even on Conventional PCI systems, so I doubt this is
anything specific to PCIe or AER, and maybe Linux should clear it
after enumerating devices below the bridge.

Yes, that is certainly true but why does that matter? Stats are always a
snapshot of the past. Do we get an inconsistent image that would be
actively harmful.

Please tell us more about those and why should all others that do not
require such a precision should page that price as well.

AFAICS cgroup_rstat_flush is allowed to sleep so spinlocks are not
really possible.

You will have potentially many spinners for something that might take
quite a lot of time (sleep) if there is nothing else to schedule. I do
not think this is a proper behavior. Really, you shouldn't be busy
waiting for a sleeper.

mutex_try_lock for non-critical flushers and mutex_lock of syncing ones.
We can talk a custom locking scheme if that proves insufficient or
problematic.

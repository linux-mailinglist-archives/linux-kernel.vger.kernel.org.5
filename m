Yeah, possibly, and device links may also come into play here.

The patch itself is of course fine itself as a clean up (or
microoptimisation) but the claim that it solves, and is the correct fix
for, a probe loop issue is not obvious at all and requires some further
justification.

Since he last time someone suggested reverting the commit that
introduced the probe-loop issue, the result was to leave things as they
were and just document the workaround, it should be fine to just refer
to that commit:

	fbc35b45f9f6 ("Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER")

Perhaps you can keep the Subject if you make it clear in the commit
message that this bug isn't always hit with QRTR=m.

Fair enough. I'm genuinely trying to have a precise understanding of
this, not trying to be dismissive.

So the debate is really whether it makes sense at all to support
Secure Launch on systems that are stuck on an obsolete and broken hash
algorithm. This is not hyperbole: SHA-1 is broken today and once these
changes hit production 1-2 years down the line, the situation will
only have deteriorated. And another 2-3 years later, we will be the
ones chasing obscure bugs on systems that were already obsolete when
this support was added.

So what is the value proposition here? An end user today, who is
mindful enough of security to actively invest the effort to migrate
their system from ordinary measured boot to secure launch, is really
going to do so on a system that only implements SHA-1 support?

The end user can do whatever they want, of course. Whether it belongs
in the upstream is an entirely different matter, though, especially
because we will effectively be forced to support this forever.

Yes, this crossed my mind as well. There is a Kconfig symbol
CRYPTO_USER_API_ENABLE_OBSOLETE I added a while ago for a similar
purpose.

I am still disappointed that we have to go down this path, but I
understand the concerns now that you have explained them to me (again)
in more detail.

These considerations need to be recorded in the documentation or
commit logs as well, so that we can easily refer back to them without
having to dig through the mail archives.

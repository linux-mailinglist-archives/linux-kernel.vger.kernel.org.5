Is (2) a special case of (1)? (I want to make sure I understand all the
cases.)

I'd lean more towards the way AArch64 goes, because, unless /proc/cpuinfo
is just a blind regurgitation of an isa string from DT / ACPI, then the
kernel must at least know something about it. Advertising a feature which
is known, but also known not to work, seems odd to me. So my vote is that
only features which are present and enabled in the kernel or present and
not necessary to be enabled in the kernel in order for userspace or
virtual machines to use be advertised in /proc/cpuinfo.

We still have SMBIOS (dmidecode) to blindly dump what the hardware
supports for cases (1) and (2) above.

I agree with your this suggestion here. It is easier to understand:

if (time_after_eq(now, period_ts + get_softlockup_thresh() / 5))
   set_potential_softlockup_hardirq();

Please let me explain the criteria for the judgment here. Under normal
circumstances, "softlockup_fn" will be woken up every "sample_period" to
update "period_ts", and the "time_after_eq" I written will be false. If
"period_ts" has not been updated after a "sample_period" has passed,
then the "time_after_eq" will be true. And I suspect that in the 
subsequent few "sample_period", "period_ts" might also not be updated,
which could indicate a potential softlockup. At this point, I use
"need_record_irq_counts" to determine if this phenomenon is caused by an
interrupt storm.

To summarize, my condition to start counting interrupts is that
"period_ts" has not been updated during "sample_period" AND the 
proportion of hardirq time during "sample_period" exceeds 50%.

What do you think?

By the way, The reason for having both set_potential_softlockup() and
set_potential_softlockup_hardirq() is that I once wrote a
set_potential_softlockup_softirq() for starting counting softirqs.
However, I found it might not very meaningful and removed it. I will
follow your suggestion and make improvements to make this area more
understandable.

As previously mentioned, I had considered counting softirqs. I will 
refactor 'need_record_irq_counts'.

Oh, I assumed that "nr_irqs" would remain constant at runtime, but I 
will consider scenarios where it might grow.

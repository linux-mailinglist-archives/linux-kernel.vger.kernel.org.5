Right now, we are able to do isolcpus=domain with the isolated cpuset partition functionality. Other aspects of CPU isolation are being looked at with the goal of reducing the gap of what one can do at boot time versus what can be done at run time. It will certain take time to reach that goal.

So rcu_nocb is ready for dynamically changing it without too much 
additional work. That is good to know as I haven't looked into that myself.

The other pieces will still need additional work. I already have a patch 
in the cgroup tree that updates the unbound workqueue affinity to 
exclude isolated cpuset CPUs, though there may still be some further 
fine tuning that can be done.

Yes, I recall some of the discussion now. I am fine with a single on/off 
switch. That will likely simplify the process as we can add additional 
isolation features over time once the code is ready, may be a 
cpuset.cpus.isolation_full boolean flag.

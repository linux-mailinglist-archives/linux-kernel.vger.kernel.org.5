What are these messages that are sent before assignment of a bus number?

What's the user-visible issue that occurs when they're blocked?

Doesn't disabling Source Validation introduce a security hole because the
device may spoof messages before Source Validation is re-enabled?

PCIe r6.1 sec 6.12.1.1 does indeed point out that the downstream device
is *permitted* to send these messages but the Implementation Note
does *not* prescribe that Source Validation shall be disabled to let them
through.  It merely points out that the messages may be filtered if
Source Validation is enabled.

Thanks,

Lukas

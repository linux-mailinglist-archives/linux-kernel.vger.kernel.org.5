Yes, the maximum speed of JH7110 PCIe is 5.0 GT/s (Gen2x1).

About starfive_pcie_host_wait_for_link():
JH7110 SoC only has one root port in each PCIe controller (2 in total)
and they do not support hot-plug yet.
Thus, We add starfive_pcie_host_wait_for_link() to poll if it is a empty slot.
If nothing here, we will exit the probe() of this controller, and it will not
go into pci_host_probe() too.
This may not be a very standard logic, should we remove it or rewrite in a better way?

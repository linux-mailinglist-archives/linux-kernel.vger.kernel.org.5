I did a "make clean" to reset the source tree and recompiled.  However, it
errored out:

  drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:988:24: error: ‘RESOURCE_SIZE_MAX’ undeclared
  drivers/pci/setup-bus.c:998:17: error: ‘pci_bus_for_each_resource’ undeclared

This was with the patch series applied against 5.15.141.  It seems the patch
targets a kernel that's too far removed from 5.15.x.

Which kernel would you like me to apply the patch series to and test?

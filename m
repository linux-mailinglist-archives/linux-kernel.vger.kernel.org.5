Sure; I've added explicit "note" lines to v2 for that.

Yup; I had hoped that the comment within panic_stop_irqoff_fn() was sufficient
for that:

	/*
	 * Trigger the panic after all other CPUs have entered this function,
	 * so that they are guaranteed to have IRQs disabled.
	 */

I've made that a bit more explicit now:

	/*
	 * As stop_machine() disables interrupts, all CPUs within this function
	 * have interrupts disabled and cannot take a regular IPI.
	 *
	 * The last CPU which enters here will trigger a panic, and as all CPUs
	 * cannot take a regular IPI, we'll only be able to stop secondaries if
	 * smp_send_stop() or crash_smp_send_stop() uses an NMI.
	 */

Hopefully the above is good enough?

I agree the stop_machine() naming is also somewhat confusing here, but I can't
do much about that.

Thanks!

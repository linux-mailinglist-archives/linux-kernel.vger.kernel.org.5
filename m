I suggest to split a code refactoring (which is not expected to bring any
functional changes) and an actual change of the behavior on cgroup v1.
Re the refactoring: I see a lot of value in adding comments and make the
code more readable, I don't see that much value in merging two variables.
But if it comes organically with the code simplification - nice.

Yeah, I can see it. But Idk if it's too workload-specific to have
a single-policy-fits-all-cases approach.
E.g. some workloads might prefer to have a portion of pagecache
being reclaimed.
What do you think?

Thanks for the clarification!

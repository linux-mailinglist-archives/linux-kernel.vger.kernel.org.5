Yes, my point is that only first ext4_mb_load_buddy_gfp of a group will
do real buddy initialization which will generate buddy from on-disk bitmap
and data from ext4_mb_free_metadata. Any code after ext4_mb_load_buddy_gfp
has no race with buddy initialization. As ext4_mb_free_metadata is called
after ext4_mb_load_buddy_gfp, there is no race with buddy initialization.

After this patchset, here is all paths to cooperate update of on-disk bitmap
and buddy bitmap in seperate lock (search all functions calling
ext4_mb_load_buddy or ext4_mb_load_buddy_gfp to find potential code path to
update both on-disk bitmap and buddy bitmap):
code to free blocks:
ext4_group_add_blocks (lock is separated in this patchset)
  lock
  clear on-disk bitmap
  unlock

  lock
  clear buddy bitmap
  unlock

ext4_mb_clear_bb (lock is separated in this patchset)
  lock
  clear on-disk bitmap
  unlock

  lock
  clear buddy bitmap
  unlock

code to alloc blocks:
ext4_mb_new_blocks (lock was separated before)
  lock
  search and set buddy bitmap
  unlock

  ext4_mb_mark_diskspace_used
    lock
    set on-disk bitmap
    unlock

We always clear on-disk bitmap first, and then clear buddy bitmap during
free while we do allocation on reverse order, i.e. seach and set buddy
bitmap first, and then set on-disk bitmap.
With this order, we know that bits are cleared in both on-dism bitmap
and buddy bitmap when it's seen from allocation.

Yes, this is also explained in [1].

Sure, I will split this patch in next version and add details discussed to
commit.

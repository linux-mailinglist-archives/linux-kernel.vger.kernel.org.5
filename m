Sure i'll try to collect that. The system freezes when such a situation 
happens and i'm not able
to collect much information. I'll try to crash the kernel and collect 
kdump and see if i can get that info.

Can low available memory be a reason for a thread to not be able to 
close the transaction handle for a long time?
Maybe some writeback thread starts the handle but is not able to 
complete writeback?

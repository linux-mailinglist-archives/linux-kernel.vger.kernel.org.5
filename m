Yes, it is true for C, so will Rust-for-linux need to add refcount for
most exported kernel C structure? such as by implementing AlwaysRefCounted
traits?

The issue is less serious for blk-mq request, which is pre-allocated,
and one freed request just means it can be re-allocated for other IO
in same queue, and the pointed memory won't be really freed.

Also as I mentioned, inside driver's ->timeout(), the request is
guaranteed to be live by block layer core(won't be re-allocated to other IO),
the passed-in request is referenced already, please see bt_iter() which
is called from blk_mq_timeout_work(). Here, block layer core just
borrows request, then passed the reference to ->timeout(), when
request is owned by driver actually.

I understand Rust block driver still need to implement ->queue_rq(),
->timeout(), ..., just like C driver, but maybe I am wrong? Or Rust block driver
will re-implement part of block layer core code? such as, get one extra
reference of request no matter block core has done that.

block layer has provided such guarantee if Rust driver follows current
block driver model.

After queue_rq(req) is called, request ownership is actually transferred to
driver like Rust's move, then driver is free to call blk_mq_tag_to_rq(), and
finally return request to block core after the request is completed by driver.

The biggest question should be how Rust block driver will be designed &
implemented? Will rust block driver follow current C driver's model, such
as implementing ->queue_rq(), ->timeout(), ->complete()...?

Hi Kai,
Thanks for your suggestions. I'll adopt most of it as it.
Minor details below.

Agree with the flow.
The con is that this function may block too long that is unacceptable for  
some callers like synchronous flow which only needs some minimal (e.g.,  
one page to pass try_charge()) to make forward progress. Convention is to  
call this function loops to ensure caller's condition is met, i.e., the  
way the original sgx_reclaim_pages() is called in existing code.

Right. Pages are still in the global list at the moment and only global  
reclaiming is active until the "turn on" patch. Separating out is really  
just for the purpose of review IMHO.

Sorry above did not characterize your suggestion accurately.
I'll keep the sync reclaim flow in for now unless strong objections.

Ok. I can drop it if no objections from others.
This was in from the beginning and I saw couple of other examples in  
existing code that explains expected usage. So I thought we were supposed  
to do that.

Given the stack traces, it is very much a different problem.

The patch which you've included is dangerous and can cause file system
corruption.  See my reply at [1], and your corrected patch which
addressed my concern at [2].  If folks want to try a patch, please use
the one at [2], and not the one you quoted in this thread, since it's
missing critically needed locking.

The reason why we never pursued it is because (a) at one of our weekly
ext4 video chats, I was informed by Oleg Kiselev that the performance
issue was addressed in a different way, and (b) I'd want to reproduce
the issue on a machine under my control so I could understand what was
was going on and so we could examine the dynamics of what was
happening with and without the patch.  So I'd would have needed to
know how many CPU's what kind of storage device (HDD?, SSD?  md-raid?
etc.) was in use, in addition to the fio recipe.

Finally, I'm a bit nervous about setting the internal __WQ_ORDERED
flag with max_active > 1.  What was that all about, anyway?

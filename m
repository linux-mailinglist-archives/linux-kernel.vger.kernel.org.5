The show callback gets a pointer to the attribute it was called with, so
you know the file that was opened and can figure it out from there as to
what it should print out.

I think right now it returns an error, right?  That's not good as
userspace is going to think "this attribute really isn't there if I
can't read from it" as that is how all other sysfs files work.

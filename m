I don't think we should add this to system_uses_irq_prio_masking(); that's used
by the low-level flags manipulation code that gets inlined all over the place,
and that code will work regarldess of whether we actually use NMI priorities.

If we want to avoid using PMR masking *at all* on these platforms, we'd need to
detect that within can_use_gic_priorities() or early_enable_pseudo_nmi().

Thanks,
Mark.

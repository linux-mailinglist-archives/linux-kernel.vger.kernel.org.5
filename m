Now that I read through it with a fresh pair of eyes, this is exactly 
the problem!

It's not available even as a symlink in OpenSuse TW / Slowroll I'm afraid.

I meant that calling kernel-install in OpenSuse only seems to then call 
dracut to build an initramfs for the kernel. I can call dracut myself 
without adding an unnecessary middleman (kernel-install) in the process 
and less verbosely too: dracut --kver $(make -s kernelrelease)

Perhaps you could add generic details such as I provided in the 
reference section for distros where installkernel doesn't exist or don't 
perform all the steps required.

Sorry, I don't remember. The compile/build threw some error and I looked 
up how to install kernel building dependencies in OpenSuse only to find 
out there was a pattern for it already.

Perhaps you could list the basic dependencies in the main section and 
provide the collection/patterns in the reference section.

Please, could you tell me where to report this bug? Kernel bugzilla? 
Which category/component? Thanks for all your help ðŸ˜‰

Kind regards,

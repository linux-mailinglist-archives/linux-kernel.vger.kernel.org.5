Do you mean that the guest pretends it has more cpus than the host provides
to it? I think such cpu starving configuration is prone to softlockups
already, so it wouldn't be new.

If you mean the guest has as many cpus as the host provides to it, but you
stress with many more than that number of processes, then I wonder how
softlockups would happen due to the extra processes. Since irqs are disabled
through the whole operation, the extra processes can't become scheduled, and
not being scheduled due to overloading doesn't trigger softlockups, hmm...

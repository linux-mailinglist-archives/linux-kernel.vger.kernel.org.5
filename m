At the point in time when support for the new controller was added, ks_pcie_ops
was defined as:
static struct pci_ops ks_pcie_ops = {
	.map_bus = dw_pcie_own_conf_map_bus,
	.read = pci_generic_config_read,
	.write = pci_generic_config_write,
};
which did not have anything version specific.

It is only after commit 6ab15b5e7057 that a version specific .add_bus method was
added to ks_pcie_ops, making ks_pcie_ops version-specific since then.

Sure. Thank you for the suggestion. I will leave ks_pcie_ops as-is for the older
3.65 controller while adding the ks_pcie_am6_ops without the .add_bus method for
the newer 4.90 controller. I assume this should be acceptable since the
pci-keystone.c driver only has two controller versions, namely 3.65a and 4.90a,
with the new 4.90a controller only applicable to AM654x SoC which is already
being distinguished in the driver using the is_am6 flag.

In the v3 patch, I will add the following:

static struct pci_ops ks_pcie_am6_ops = {
	.map_bus = dw_pcie_own_conf_map_bus,
	.read = pci_generic_config_read,
	.write = pci_generic_config_write,
};

and also update ks_pcie_host_init() to the following:
if(ks_pcie->is_am6)
	pp->bridge->ops = &ks_pcie_am6_ops;
else
	pp->bridge->ops = &ks_pcie_ops;

Yes, I will drop it for the new 4.90a controller rather than making it a no-op.

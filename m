We're clearly talking past each other. When I'm saying reset is asserted
on each boot, I'm referring to reset being asserted in
qcom_pcie_init_2_7_0(), whereas you appear to be referring to whether
the reset has been left asserted by the bootloader when the driver
probes.

I understand what you meant to say now, but I think you should rephrase:

	At least on SC8280XP, if the PCIe reset is asserted, the
	corresponding AUX_CLK will be stuck at 'off'.

because as it stands, it sounds like the problem happens when the driver
asserts reset.

You meant to say WWAN (modem).

That's why I said "generally".

I agree, I was misinterpreting the commit message.

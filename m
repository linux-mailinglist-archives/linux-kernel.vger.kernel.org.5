Ah, then this implementation might be an overkill.  You're still using
the (intermediate) vmalloc buffer allocated via PCM managed mode, and
the actual data is copied from/to there.  So it doesn't conflict with
the mmap operation at all.

I guess that the problem you're trying to solve (the immediate data
transfer to the queue) can be implemented rather via PCM ack callback
instead.  ALSA PCM core notifies the possible data transfer via PCM
ack callback right after each change of appl_ptr or hw_ptr, including
each read/write op or mmap commit.  Then the driver can check the
change of appl_ptr (or hw_ptr for capture), fetch the newly available
data, and queue it immediately.

Usually together with the use of ack callback, the driver sets
SNDRV_PCM_INFO_SYNC_APPLPTR flag.  This prevents the mmap of the PCM
control record (not the audio data) and enforces the use of
SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_SYNC_PTR ioctl instead (so that the driver always gets
the ack callback).

Takashi

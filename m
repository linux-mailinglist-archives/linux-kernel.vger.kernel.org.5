Sure！I'll try to push this test case to xfstests.

Yes, the fsstress here is just to fill up the remaining space on the disk.

Exactly!

Okay, thank you very much for your careful review.
The 2nd and 3rd cases of adjusting the best extent are impossible to 
overflow,
so only the first case is converted here.

I added the helper functions here for two reasons:
1. restricting the type of the return value.
2. This avoids the ugly line breaks in most cases.

The fex_end() indeed doesn't look as clean as the pa_end(), because we 
might use
the start of the free extent plus some other length to get a new end, 
like right in
ext4_mb_new_inode_pa(), which makes me have to add another extra length
argument, but I think it's worth it, and even with the addition of a 
parameter
that will probably be unused, it still looks a lot shorter than the 
original code.

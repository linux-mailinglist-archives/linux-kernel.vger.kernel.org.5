No, I didn't mean that.

Look at your code, having nbits == 0 in mind:

       const size_t index = BIT_WORD(start);
       const unsigned long offset = start % BITS_PER_LONG;
       const unsigned long space = BITS_PER_LONG - offset;
       unsigned long value_low, value_high;

       if (space >= nbits) // This is always the case
               return (map[index] >> offset) & GENMASK(nbits - 1, 0);
       ...             ^^                      ^^
                       Unconditional fetch     Wshift-count-overflow

Thanks to GENMASK() implementation, you'll be warned by GENMASK_INPUT_CHECK()
if nbits is a compile-time variable. In case of runtime, it's a pure undef,
not mentioning useless, expensive and dangerous fetch.

I think that instead of speculations, it's better to cover nbits == 0
with the explicit tests for run- and compile-time. That way you're
always on a safe side.

bitmap_get_val(NULL, 0, 0) shouldn't crash the kernel.

Alexander is right - we can't avoid testing against 0 if we need to
test for 0... In case of other functions we have inline and outline
implementations, controlled by small_const_nbits().

As you can see, the small_const_nbits() tests against 0 explicitly,
although it's free at compile time. But if nbits == 0, we pick
outline version of a function regardless.

On their turn, outline versions again do their test against nbits == 0,
but most of the time implicitly.

In case of bitmap_set_val, we are touching at max 2 words, and there's
no reason for outline version, so we have to test nbits against 0
inside inline code. 

Having all that in mind, and because nbits == 0 is most likely an
error we'd follow the following rules:
 - no memory must be touched as we're potentially in error condition,
   and pointer may be corrupted;
 - the cost of the check must be as minimal as possible.

So I suggest:

        if (unlikely(nbits == 0))
                return;

For readers that would literally mean: we don't expect that, and we find
it suspicious, but we'll handle that as correct as we can.

By the way, Alexander, please drop that 'const' things. Those are for
pointers or some global variables, not for inline functions with 4
lines of code. (If you think it helps the code to be safe than no - it's
unsafe even with consts.)

Thanks,
Yury

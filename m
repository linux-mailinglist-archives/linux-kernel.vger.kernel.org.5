Yes in principle, but there are 4 places where free_swap_and_cache() is called,
and only 2 of those are really amenable to batching (zap_pte_range() and
madvise_free_pte_range()). So the other two users will still take the "slow"
path. Maybe those 2 callsites are the only ones that really matter? I can
certainly have a stab at this approach.

I'm not sure I've understood this. Isn't advancing just a matter of:

entry = swp_entry(swp_type(entry), swp_offset(entry) + 1);

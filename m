I was under the impression that posting patches when the merge window is closed
will be met with a "post your patch later when the merge window is open"
response. That is why I chose the "RFC patch" path since RFCs can be posted anytime.

For the Networking Subsystem, it is documented that patches with new features
shouldn't be posted when the merge window is closed. I have mostly posted
patches for the Networking Subsystem and am not sure about the rules for the
device-tree bindings and PCI Subsystems. To be on the safe side I posted this
patch as an RFC patch.

Thank you for clarifying that it is alright to post patches even when merge
window is closed. Going forward I shall not post RFC patches unless it really
requires feedback and suggestions.

Siddharth.

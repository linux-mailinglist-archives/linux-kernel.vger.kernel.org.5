From: Nuno Sa <nuno.sa@analog.com>

For device links, releasing the supplier/consumer devices references
happens asynchronously in device_link_release_fn(). Hence, the possible
release of an of_node is also asynchronous. If these nodes were added
through overlays we have a problem because this does not respect the
devicetree overlays assumptions that when a changeset is
being removed in __of_changeset_entry_destroy(), it must hold the last
reference to that node. Due to the async nature of device links that
cannot be guaranteed.

Given the above, in case one of the link consumer/supplier is part of
an overlay node we call directly device_link_release_fn() instead of
queueing it. Yes, it might take some significant time for
device_link_release_fn() to complete because of synchronize_srcu() but
we would need to, anyways, wait for all OF references to be released if
we want to respect overlays assumptions.

This RFC is a follow up of a previous one that I sent to the devicetree
folks [1]. It got rejected because it was not really fixing the root
cause of the issue (which I do agree). Please see the link where I
fully explain what the issue is.

I did also some git blaming and did saw that commit
80dd33cf72d1 ("drivers: base: Fix device link removal") introduced
queue_work() as we could be releasing the last device reference and hence
sleeping which is against SRCU callback requirements. However, that same
commit is now making use of synchronize_srcu() which may take
significant time (and I think that's the reason for the work item?).

However, given the dt overlays requirements, I'm not seeing any
reason to not be able to run device_link_release_fn() synchronously if we
detect an OVERLAY node is being released. I mean, even if we come up
(and I did some experiments in this regard) with some async mechanism to
release the OF nodes refcounts, we still need a synchronization point
somewhere.

Anyways, I would like to have some feedback on how acceptable would this
be or what else could I do so we can have a "clean" dt overlay removal.

I'm also cc'ing dts folks so they can give some comments on the new
device_node_overlay_removal() function. My goal is to try to detect when an
overlay is being removed (maybe we could even have an explicit flag for
it?) and only directly call device_link_release_fn() in that case.

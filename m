It's hard to qualify and always a matter of personal viewpoint/opinion,
but I'd say: kernel from the merge window are pretty stable and
reliable. But sure, accidents that eat data happen and they happen
slightly more often during merge windows because the rate of change is
higher. But in the end they do not happen often, which is why Fedora
rawhide for example ships merge window kernels all the time.

Well, that's up to you -- but the reality is also that developers are
not obliged to look into regressions report closely, unless someone
bisected it.

Maybe too few people (or too few of those that run the latest kernels)
use hibernate these days (I haven't for more than 15 years), which is
why it's not tested much.

Maybe you were lucky, maybe someone else bisected and reported the problem.

Not really, as it always depends on the situation. There are bugs (like
https://lore.kernel.org/all/08275279-7462-4f4a-a0ee-8aa015f829bc@leemhuis.info/
) where a report without a bisection is enough. But there are others
where it's unlikely that anyone will take a closer look; a lot of those
reg. suspend/hibernate fall into this category, as problems in that area
can be cause by any subsystem and its drivers -- which is why the power
management people can't look into most of those, as then they quickly
wouldn't get anything else done while spending time on bugs most of the
time other people caused.

Ciao, Thorsten

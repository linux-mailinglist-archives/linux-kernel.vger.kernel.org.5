I think, I know what you mean, basically:

------------------------------
struct em_perf_table {
	struct rcu_head rcu;
	struct em_perf_state state[];
}

kzalloc(sizeof(struct em_perf_table) + N * sizeof(struct em_perf_state))

------

IMO that should also be OK in the rest of places.
I agree the alloc/free code would be smaller.

Let me do that than.

Yes

Yes, I have presented those ~2y ago in Android Gerrit world
(got feedback from a few vendors) and in a few Linux conferences.

For now we don't plan to have this feature for the thermal
governor or something similar.

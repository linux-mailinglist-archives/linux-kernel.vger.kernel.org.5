Summary
=======
These patches[1] support UHS-II and fix GL9755 UHS-II compatibility.

About UHS-II, roughly deal with the following three parts:
1) A UHS-II detection and initialization:
- Host setup to support UHS-II (Section 3.13.1 Host Controller Setup
  Sequence[2]).
- Detect a UHS-II I/F (Section 3.13.2 Card Interface Detection Sequence
  [2]).
- In step(9) of Section 3.13.2 in [2], UHS-II initialization is include
  Section 3.13.3 UHS-II Card Initialization and Section 3.13.4 UHS-II
  Setting Register Setup Sequence.

2) Send Legacy SD command through SD-TRAN
- Encapsulated SD packets are defined in SD-TRAN in order to ensure Legacy
  SD compatibility and preserve Legacy SD infrastructures (Section 7.1.1
  Packet Types and Format Overview[3]).
- Host issue a UHS-II CCMD packet or a UHS-II DCMD (Section 3.13.5 UHS-II
  CCMD Packet issuing and Section 3.13.6 UHS-II DCMD Packet issuing[2]).

3) UHS-II Interrupt
- Except for UHS-II error interrupts, most interrupts share the original
  interrupt registers.

patch#21:    for GL9755

Changes in v14 (January. 23, 2024)
* rebased to the linux-kernel-v6.7.0-rc4 in Ulf Hansson next branch.
* according to the comments provided by Adrian Hunter to modify the
  patches base on the [V13 00/21] Add support UHS-II for GL9755.
* Patch#03: Move mmc_card_uhs2() to include/linux/mmc/host.h, so that
            mmc_card_uhs2() can be available for host drivers.
* Patch#10: Use mmc_card_uhs2() to stead sdhci_uhs2_mode() in the
            sdhci_uhs2_dump_regs().
* Patch#11: Since mmc_card_uhs2() is the same as sdhci_uhs2_mode(), so
            drop sdhci_uhs2_mode() and use mmc_card_uhs2() instead of
            sdhci_uhs2_mode().

            sdhci_uhs2_set_ios().
* Patch#16: Use mmc_card_uhs2() to stead sdhci_uhs2_mode() in the
            sdhci_uhs2_request().
* Patch#17: Use mmc_card_uhs2() to stead sdhci_uhs2_mode() in the
            sdhci_uhs2_complete_work(), sdhci_uhs2_irq() and
            sdhci_uhs2_thread_irq().
* Patch#18: Use mmc_card_uhs2() to stead sdhci_uhs2_mode() in the
            __sdhci_uhs2_remove_host().

----------------- original cover letter from v3.1 -----------------
This is an interim snapshot of our next version, v4, for enabling
UHS-II on MMC/SD.

It is focused on 'sdhci' side to address Adrian's comments regarding
"modularising" sdhci-uhs2.c.
The whole aim of this version is to get early feedback from Adrian (and
others) on this issue. Without any consensus about the code structure,
it would make little sense to go further ahead on sdhci side.
(Actually, Adrian has made no comments other than "modularising" so far.)

I heavily reworked/refactored sdhci-uhs2.c and re-organised the patch
set to meet what I believe Adrian expects; no UHS-II related code in
Legacy (UHS-I) code or sdhci.c.

Nevertheless, almost of all changes I made are trivial and straightforward
in this direction, and I believe that there is no logic changed since v3
except sdhci_uhs2_irq(), as ops->irq hook, where we must deal with UHS-II
command sequences in addition to UHS-II errors. So I added extra handlings.

I admit that there is plenty of room for improvements (for example,
handling host->flags), but again the focal point here is how sdhci-uhs2.c
should be built as a module.

Please review this series (particularly Patch#8-#26 and #27) from this
viewpoint in the first place.
(Ben is working on 'host' side but there is no change on 'host' side
in this submission except a minor tweak.)

Thanks,
-Takahiro Akashi

Changes in v3 (Jul. 10, 2020)
* rebased to v5.8-rc4
* add copyright notice
* reorganize the patch set and split some commits into smaller ones
* separate uhs-2 headers from others
* correct wrong spellings
* fix most of checkpatch warnings/errors
* remove all k[cz]alloc() from the code
* guard sdhci-uhs2 specific code with
      'if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI_UHS2))'
* make sdhci-uhs2.c as a module
* trivial changes, including
  - rename back sdhci-core.c to sdhci.c
  - allow vendor code to disable uhs2 if v4_mode == 0
      in __sdhci_add_host()
  - merge uhs2_power_up() into mmc_power_up()
  - remove flag_uhs2 from mmc_attach_sd()
  - add function descriptions to EXPORT'ed functions
  - other minor code optimization

Hello Ojaswin,

This sounded strange, so I added the following debugging information:

diff --git a/fs/ext4/mballoc.c b/fs/ext4/mballoc.c
index c65fac9b8c72..c6ec423e2971 100644

         grp->bb_fragments = fragments;
+       pr_err(">>> greoup: %u, bb_free: %d, bb_fragments: %d\n", 
grp->bb_group, grp->bb_free, grp->bb_fragments);

         if (free != grp->bb_free) {
                 ext4_grp_locked_error(sb, group, 0, 0,


Then mount an ext4 image , wait for a moment , and got the
following printout:

OK, waiting for your good news.

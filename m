It depends on how userspace use this api to limit the number of pmcr. I 
think what you mean in the code is that userspace need to set every 
vcpu's pmcr to the same value, so the `unlikely` here is right, only one 
vcpu can change the kvm->arch.pmcr.n, it saves the cpu cycles.

What suggest above might be wrong. Since I think when userspace want to 
limit the number of pmcr, it may just set the new_n on one vcpu, since 
the kvm->arch.pmcr_n is a VM-local value, every vcpu can see it, so it's 
`likely` the (new_n <= kvm->arch.pmcr_n_limit), it can decrease one 
checking statement.

Thanks,

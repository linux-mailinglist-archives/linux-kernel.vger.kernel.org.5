Hi Maciej,

   Sure. Let's go with 8000 to leave some space for headers. And would 
add the following paragraph as comment for readers to understand why 
this value was set:

"Although max mtu as dictated by u_ether is 15412 bytes, setting 
max_segment_size to 15426 would not be efficient. If user chooses 
segment size to be (> 8192), then we can't aggregate more than one 
buffer in each NTB (assuming each packet coming from network layer is > 
8192 bytes) as ep maxpacket limit is 16384. So let max_segment_size be 
limited to 8000 to allow atleast 2 packets to be aggregated reducing 
wastage of NTB buffer space"

Hope that would be fine.

Regards,
Krishna,

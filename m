Could you share what parameters you changed to get this high value of 
iperf throughput.

>Right, same goes for using 5K vs 5.5K MTU. If MTU is 5K, 3 packets can 
conveniently fit into an NTB but if its 5.5, at max only two (5.5k) 
packets can fit in (essentially filling ~11k of the 16384 bytes and 
wasting the rest)

And whether its Ipv4/Ipv6 like you mentioned on [1], the MTU is what NCM 
layer receives and we append the Ethernet header and add NCM headers and 
send it out after aggregation. Why can't we set the MAX_DATAGRAM_SIZE to 
~8050 or ~8100 ? The reason I say this value is, obviously setting it to 
8192 would not efficiently use the NTB buffer. We need to fill as much 
space in buffer as possible and assuming that each packet received on 
ncm layer is of MTU size set (not less that that), we can assume that 
even if only 2 packets are aggregated (minimum aggregation possible), we 
would be filling (2 * (8050 + ETH_HLEN) + (room for NCM headers)) would 
almost be close to 16384 ep max packet size. I already check 8050 MTU 
and it works. We can add a comment in code detailing the above 
explanation and why we chose to use 8050 or 8100 as MAX_DATAGRAM_SIZE.

Hope my reasoning of why we can chose 8.1K or 8.05K makes sense. Let me 
know your thoughts on this.

Krishna,

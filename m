Could you please have look at what DW PCIe IP-core version is utilized
in the Keystone PCIe host controller? If it's of v5.x then here is
what HW databook says about the BARs initialization: "If you do use a
BAR, then you should program it to capture TLPs that are targeted to
your local non-application memory space residing on TRGT1, and not for
the application on TRGT0 (dbi). The BAR range must be outside of the
three Base/Limit regions."

I have no idea whether the BAR being set with an address within the
Base/Limit regions could have caused the lags you see, but I would
have at least checked that.

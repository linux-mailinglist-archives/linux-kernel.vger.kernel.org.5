Wow, hugepage_vma_check() is a very complicated function.  I'm glad I
ignored it!

I guess so ...

I deliberately ignored the humungous complexity of the THP options.
They're overgrown and make my brain hurt.  Instead, large folios are
adaptive; they observe the behaviour of the user program and choose based
on history what to do.  This is far superior to having a sysadmin tell
us what to do!

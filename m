I haven't digested the rest of the email yet (Friday brain, sorry) but I
do not think you are adressing this particular part so let me ask before
I dive more into the following. I really do not follow the serialization
requirement here because the lock doesn't really serialize the flushing,
does it? At least not in a sense of a single caller to do the flushing
atomicaly from other flushers. It is possible that the current flusher
simply drops the lock midway and another one retakes the lock and
performs the operation again. So what additional flushing
synchronization does it provide and why cannot parallel flushers simply
compete over pcp spinlocks?

So what am I missing?

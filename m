Maybe these systems need to add a little delay when the display is 
turned off, in order to give the touchpanel time to disconnect before 
the system suspend begins.

In that case the root hub should not generate a wakeup request in 
response to the touchpanel disconnecting.

That shouldn't happen either.  Disabling wakeup on the root hub should 
not prevent the root hub from relaying wakeup requests it receives from 
downstream devices.  It should merely prevent the root hub from 
generating its own wakeup requests for connects, disconnects, and 
over-current events.

It sounds like the xhci root-hub code isn't doing the right thing, at 
least, not on your systems.

nmi_trigger_cpumask_backtrace() has its own copy of the cpu mask.
What about changing the @exclude_self parameter to @exclude_cpu
and do:

	if (exclude_cpu >= 0)
		cpumask_clear_cpu(exclude_cpu, to_cpumask(backtrace_mask));


It would require changing also arch_trigger_cpumask_backtrace() to

	void arch_trigger_cpumask_backtrace(const struct cpumask *mask,
				    int exclude_cpu);

but it looks doable.


It might theoretically change the behavior because
nmi_trigger_cpumask_backtrace() does

	this_cpu = get_cpu();

I guess that it was used to make sure that smp_processor_id()
the same. But it is too late. It should ignore the callers CPU.
So, this might actually fix a possible race.

Note that get_cpu() also disabled preemption. IMHO, it is not strictly needed.
But it might make sense to keep it because the backtraces are printed
when something goes wrong and it should print backtraces from the current state.

Best Regards,
Petr

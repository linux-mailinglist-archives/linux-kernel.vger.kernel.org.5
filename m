What's the use case where there are multiple outstanding reports?  The
only use case I've currently seen is single external relying party
requesting a report with a challenge.

That's quite simple isn't it?  All the possible additional input
parameters appear as files.  If you don't echo anything into them, they
take the default values.  There's usually a single parameter that
causes the transaction to start (usually the nonce) and the transaction
takes the current values from all the files.

I'm not saying sysfs can substitute for all the transactionality of
ioctl, but in this case where everything is low volume and single
threaded it seems a reasonable choice.  For a more volume based
transactional approach, something more configfs like would work better,
so is there a use case for that?

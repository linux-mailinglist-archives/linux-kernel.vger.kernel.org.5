Yes and this is why the driver should not care. Otherwise it just
complicates things.

For instance, a root port may have _PR3 that allows the whole thing to
enter L2/3 (D3cold) but some device has d3cold_allowed set to false or
there may be a device that does not support PME on D3cold which prevents
the power to be turned off.

Is there even an AER error that can happen when a device is in D3hot
(link is in L1) or D3cold (link is in L2/3)? I'm not an expert in AER
but AFAICT these errors are reported when the device is in active state
not when it is in low power state.

All that said, Bjorn is the maintainer so he gets to decide. If this is
what he suggested then I'm fine with it. Just wanted to mention this. I
too want to see this issue fixed, one way or another ;-) Thanks for
working on this BTW!

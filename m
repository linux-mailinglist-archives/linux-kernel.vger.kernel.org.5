You mean 37A.3.1.3 (2) "Transition during power-off by module standby"?

    The AVB-DMAC completes the bus master access in progress,
    and then shifts to reset mode. At this time, the operating mode
    configuration bits in the AVB-DMAC mode register (CCC.OPC) are
    set to B'00.

"reset mode" could be interpreted as "register contents are reset (lost)".
However, the R-Car Gen3 documentation contains the same paragraph,
and register contents are known not to be lost...

37.7.2 for Ether ("sh-eth") states:

    After returning from the standby state, the ether should be reset
and initialized.

Sergey: does sh_eth.c really reinitialize the hardware completely after
pm_runtime_get_sync()?

Indeed, AFAIK all modules on SH/R-Mobile, R-Car, and RZ/G SoCs keep
their register contents when in standby-mode (module standby enabled).
On modules in a (not always-on) power area (e.g. SH/R-Mobile), register
contents are lost when the power area is powered down.
So I'd be surprised if EtherAVB behaves differently.  Of course that
is still possible, there are big difference between EtherAVB in R-Car
Gen2 and RZ/G1, and the revision found in later SoC families.

Iff register contents are lost on RZ/G1H, I'd rather add
an extra clk_prepare_enable(priv->clk) to ravb_probe() on
"renesas,etheravb-rcar-gen2"....

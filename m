Not true.

If a patch contains a keyword match, get_maintainers will _always_
show the K: keyword maintainers unless --nokeywords is specified
on the command line.

If a file contains a keyword match, it'll only show the K:
keyword  if --keywords-in-file is set.

Again, not true.

Patches do _not_ scan the original modified files for keyword matches.
Only the patch itself is scanned.  That's the current behavior as well.

Oh you're right, I overlooked the case where the battery is very low, in
which case bc detection should still be performed (I think, I haven't
tested it). This issue this patch is trying to fix doesn't apply in that
case, so it should be simple enough to check if the pmic has detected a
battery and skip setting the current limit if it has.

Perhaps it would be better to read the limit from the device tree, that
way it could be set higher for a specific board if it needs to draw that
much current and be able to boot without a battery? It seems sketchy to
default to a current limit significantly higher than what the usb power
supply is required to support.

Adding a dev_warn is a good idea, I'll do that.

Thanks for the review

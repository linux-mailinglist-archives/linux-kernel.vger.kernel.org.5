+description: |
+  The Arm Message Handling Unit (MHU) Version 3 is a mailbox controller that
+  enables unidirectional communications with remote processors through various
+  possible transport protocols.
+  The controller can optionally support a varying number of extensions that, in
+  turn, enable different kinds of transport to be used for communication.
+  Number, type and characteristics of each supported extension can be discovered
+  dynamically at runtime.
+
+  Given the unidirectional nature of the controller, an MHUv3 mailbox controller
+  is composed of a MHU Sender (MHUS) containing a PostBox (PBX) block and a MHU
+  Receiver (MHUR) containing a MailBox (MBX) block, where
+
+   PBX is used to
+      - Configure the MHU
+      - Send Transfers to the Receiver
+      - Optionally receive acknowledgment of a Transfer from the Receiver
+
+   MBX is used to
+      - Configure the MHU
+      - Receive Transfers from the Sender
+      - Optionally acknowledge Transfers sent by the Sender
+
+  Both PBX and MBX need to be present and defined in the DT description if you
+  need to establish a bidirectional communication, since you will have to
+  acquire two distinct unidirectional channels, one for each block.
+
+  As a consequence both blocks needs to be represented separately and specified
+  as distinct DT nodes in order to properly describe their resources.
+
+  Note that, though, thanks to the runtime discoverability, there is no need to
+  identify the type of blocks with distinct compatibles.
+
+  Following are the MHUv3 possible extensions.
+
+  - Doorbell Extension (DBE): DBE defines a type of channel called a Doorbell
+    Channel (DBCH). DBCH enables a single bit Transfer to be sent from the
+    Sender to Receiver. The Transfer indicates that an event has occurred.
+    When DBE is implemented, the number of DBCHs that an implementation of the
+    MHU can support is between 1 and 128, numbered starting from 0 in ascending
+    order and discoverable at run-time.
+    Each DBCH contains 32 individual fields, referred to as flags, each of which
+    can be used independently. It is possible for the Sender to send multiple
+    Transfers at once using a single DBCH, so long as each Transfer uses
+    a different flag in the DBCH.
+    Optionally, data may be transmitted through an out-of-band shared memory
+    region, wherein the MHU Doorbell is used strictly as an interrupt generation
+    mechanism, but this is out of the scope of these bindings.
+
+  - FastChannel Extension (FCE): FCE defines a type of channel called a Fast
+    Channel (FCH). FCH is intended for lower overhead communication between
+    Sender and Receiver at the expense of determinism. An FCH allows the Sender
+    to update the channel value at any time, regardless of whether the previous
+    value has been seen by the Receiver. When the Receiver reads the channel's
+    content it gets the last value written to the channel.
+    FCH is considered lossy in nature, and means that the Sender has no way of
+    knowing if, or when, the Receiver will act on the Transfer.
+    FCHs are expected to behave as RAM which generates interrupts when writes
+    occur to the locations within the RAM.
+    When FCE is implemented, the number of FCHs that an implementation of the
+    MHU can support is between 1-1024, if the FastChannel word-size is 32-bits,
+    or between 1-512, when the FastChannel word-size is 64-bits.
+    FCHs are numbered from 0 in ascending order.
+    Note that the number of FCHs and the word-size are implementation defined,
+    not configurable but discoverable at run-time.
+    Optionally, data may be transmitted through an out-of-band shared memory
+    region, wherein the MHU FastChannel is used as an interrupt generation
+    mechanism which carries also a pointer to such out-of-band data, but this
+    is out of the scope of these bindings.
+
+  - FIFO Extension (FE): FE defines a Channel type called a FIFO Channel (FFCH).
+    FFCH allows a Sender to send
+       - Multiple Transfers to the Receiver without having to wait for the
+         previous Transfer to be acknowledged by the Receiver, as long as the
+         FIFO has room for the Transfer.
+       - Transfers which require the Receiver to provide acknowledgment.
+       - Transfers which have in-band payload.
+    In all cases, the data is guaranteed to be observed by the Receiver in the
+    same order which the Sender sent it.
+    When FE is implemented, the number of FFCHs that an implementation of the
+    MHU can support is between 1 and 64, numbered starting from 0 in ascending
+    order. The number of FFCHs, their depth (same for all implemented FFCHs) and
+    the access-granularity are implementation defined, not configurable but
+    discoverable at run-time.
+    Optionally, additional data may be transmitted through an out-of-band shared
+    memory region, wherein the MHU FIFO is used to transmit, in order, a small
+    part of the payload (like a header) and a reference to the shared memory
+    area holding the remaining, bigger, chunk of the payload, but this is out of
+    the scope of these bindings.

+      The MHUv3 controller generates a number of events some of which are used
+      to generate interrupts; as a consequence it can expose a varying number of
+      optional PBX/MBX interrupts, representing the events generated during the
+      operation of the various transport protocols associated with different
+      extensions. All interrupts of the MHU are level-sensitive.
+      Some of these optional interrupts are defined per-channel, where the
+      number of channels effectively available is implementation defined and
+      run-time discoverable.
+      In the following names are enumerated using patterns, with per-channel
+      interrupts implicitly capped at the maximum channels allowed by the
+      specification for each extension type.
+      For the sake of simplicity maxItems is anyway capped to a most plausible
+      number, assuming way less channels would be implemented than actually
+      possible.
+
+      The only mandatory interrupts on the MHU are:
+        - combined
+        - mbx-fch-xfer-<N> but only if mbx-fcgrp-xfer-<N> is not implemented.

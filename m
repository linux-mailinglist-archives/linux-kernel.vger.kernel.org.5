For error part there are (at least superficially) similar features in the P=
CIe
standard that we've started thinking about how to support.

See Flit Logging Extended capablity (7.7.8 in PCIe Base Spec rev6.
That has the benefit that they are part of the standard so we can
support them directly in portdrv / EP drivers using some library code in the
PCI core.

There are other interconnect and PCI PMU drivers that log retries etc which=
 are also basically error
counts. At least some of that is done through perf today.=20

The addition of this type of functionality to pordrv is a long running ques=
tion.
Everyone wants a solution, I believe some people are looking at it (+CC Ter=
ry)

Terry, another case for your long list.

For the EP end, this should be fired up by the EP driver, whilst it might be
infrastructure used on a bunch of devices,  it is a feature of that particu=
lar
EP - so you'd want to provide any functionality in a form that could be used
by both the EP driver and a nice shiny new portdrv replacement.

Yes, I missed the cpuset_lock() call.

The css_set_lock protects changes made to css_set. Looking at 
cgroup_migrate_execute(), css_set_lock is taken when the tasks are 
actually moving from one css_set to another one. cpuset_attach() is 
called just to update the CPU and node affinity and cpuset_mutex is 
taken to ensure stability of the CPU and node masks. There is no change 
to css_set and so css_set_lock isn't needed.

We can argue that there can be racing between cgroup_exit() and the 
iteration of tasks in cpuset_attach() or cpuset_can_attach(). An 
rcu_read_lock() is probably needed. I am stilling investigating that.

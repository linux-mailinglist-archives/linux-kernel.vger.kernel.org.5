Not sure what exactly you meant by "host controller specific". Did you
mean a particular host-controller or all the host-controllers? I meant
that the "msg" range could be used by _any_ host-controller, but the
usage would be platform-specific indeed because the message-type depends on
the peripheral devices.

Could you please elaborate why exactly the config-region would still
be host-specific? Strictly speaking the normal MEM or IO region is
also host-specific because what lays behind depends on the attached
device and the enumeration procedure. IMO the reason of not using the
'ranges' for the config/ECAM space would be in opposite to what you
said.  Unlike the CPU-to-MEM/IO mapping the ECAM/config-space is a
pre-determined _linear_ space with in most of the case no need in
special space remapping (unless we would wish to map particular
peripheral device config-space). So normal "reg" is enough especially
seeing the config-space is a set of registers. (Please correct me if I
was wrong.)

AFAICS the next controllers might also be able to generate the
messages via the outbound AT-memory:
Rockchip PCIe controller (see pcie-rockchip.h AXI_WRAPPER_* macros)
Cadence PCIe controller (see pcie-cadence.h CDNS_PCIE_AT_OB_REGION_DESC0_TYPE_* macros)
Mediatek PCIe Gen3 controller (see pcie-mediatek-gen3.c PCIE_ATR_TLP_TYPE() macro)
..
although I am not absolutely sure.

I already sited it in the message to Frank here:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/pprkba3ygxwv4lzieu5spqamcn2gzdcviv4kb2kzkzam4fbhit@6uqtmevzm5uj/
Here is an excerpt from there:

< Note paragraph 2.1.1. of for instance the PCIe-4.0 spec:
< 
< 2.1.1  Address Spaces, Transaction Types, and Usage
< "Transactions form the basis for information transfer between a
< Requester and Completer. Four _address spaces_ are defined, and
< different Transaction types are defined, each with its own unique
< intended usage, as shown in Table 2-12."
< 
< Address Space     | Transaction Types    |  Basic Usage
< -------------------------------------------------------------------------
< Memory            | Read/Write           | Transfer data to/from a
<                   |                      | memory-mapped location
< I/O               | Read/Write           | Transfer data to/from an
<                   |                      | I/O-mapped location
< Configuration     | Read/Write           | Device Function config/setup
< _Message_         | Baseline (including  | From event signaling mechanism
<                   | Vendorâ€“Defined)      | to general purpose messaging
< 
< So basically the PCIe-spec defines four _address spaces_. The
< _message_ space is one of them. Seeing the "ranges" DT-property is
< about the space-to-space mapping IMO there is nothing wrong with using
< it for the _message_ space mapping.

As you can see the MEM, IO, config and Message are defined as address
space. Looking at the message request description in the spec, there
can be various types of the messages. All of them are listed in "2.2.8
Message Request Rules". Some of them can be routed by _address_ or
_ID_ (BDF), but some of them can lack of any address/ID field. In
accordance with the "Table 2-17: Message Routing" footnote there is no
message requests defined at the moment with the Address-based routing.
In the meantime for the address-less messages there is no address
translation needs to be performed, thus having the ranges-based
mapping would be just pointless for them. But if we had a message
request defined with the address-based routing then it might have
required a mapping similar to the MEM and IO ones.

Anyway giving to all of that a second thought, I more-and-more getting
further away from my original idea of having the config and message
region mapped over the "ranges" property. There is no actual address
translation performed at least in the second cases. So using the "ranges"
property for it would be pointless indeed... ( But originally the idea
seemed very attractive seeing the PCIe-specific "ranges" property has
unused mapping type flags and permitted special address format...


Let's get back to the Frank work then. What would you suggest as a
good solution? There are two options at the moment:
1. Define DWC-specific "msg" reg-name with a peace of the outbound
iATU space which would be used to generate the messages. (thus
implementing the same approach as being utilized for the config-space
mapping).
2. Manually, in the driver, reserve a peace of the CPU-to-PCIe-MEM
"ranges" region and have it utilized for the message request TLPs
(implemented in this patch).

The later one seems less safe since the entire outbound iATU range
could be dedicated for some platform-specific means. So reserving
a peace of it will cause problems in those platforms.

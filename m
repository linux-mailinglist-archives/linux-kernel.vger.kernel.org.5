FYI I ended up NOT taking this, because I now have thp_vma_suitable_order() and
thp_vma_suitable_orders(). The former is essentially what was there before
(except I pass the order and derive the nr_pages, alignment, etc from that
rather than using the HPAGE_* macros. The latter is just a loop that calls the
former for each order in the bitfield.

As per my response against the next patch (#4), I have now implemented
thp_vma_allowable_orders() so that the order check is in the header with an
early exit if THP is completely disabled.

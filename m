First, this is really some corner case most people don't care: during  
init, kernel can't even allocate a workqueue object. So I don't think we  
should write extra code to implement some sophisticated solution. Any  
solution we come up with may just not work as the way user want or solve  
the real issue due to the fact such allocation failure even happens at  
init time.

So IMHO the current solution should be fine and I'll answer some of your  
detailed questions below.

Can not reliably predict what will happen. Most likely the ENOMEM will be  
returned by sgx_cgroup_alloc() if reached or other error in the stack if  
not reached to sgx_cgroup_alloc()
  and user fails on creating anything.

But if they do end up creating some cgroups (sgx_cgroup_alloc() and  
everything else  on the call stack passed without failure), everything  
still kind of works for the reason answered below.

Current code has similar behavior without extra code.

But when cgroups enabled in config, global reclamation starts from root  
and reclaim from the whole hierarchy if user may still be able to create.  
Just that we don't have async/sync per-cgroup reclaim triggered.

I think we can add support for "sgx_cgroup=disabled" in future if indeed  
needed. But just for init failure, no?

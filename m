This is a good answer. So these are the 2 possible ways to give credits
to sponsors.

Does it make sense if I send a patch describing exactly this?
This is because my finding was only "Sponsored by" that looked good
to me. So I can avoid other possible pain for the future.

Right

Yes it came into my mind and I wanted to rely only on DCO dropping the
part of acked-by tag. But there are too many cons for Sponsored-by approach.

So I will go for one of the 2 ways I've been pointed.

Thank you

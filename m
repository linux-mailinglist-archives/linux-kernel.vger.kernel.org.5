Why sleep(2) not good enough for the tests?

I think first you need to show if this (2 sec stale stats) is really a
problem.

It is 2 seconds in most cases and if it is higher, the system is already
in bad shape. O(seconds) seems more dramatic. So, why 2 seconds
staleness is not acceptable? Is 1 second acceptable? or 500 msec? Let's
look at the use-cases below.

I don't see why userspace OOM killing and proactive reclaim need
subsecond accuracy. Please explain. Same for system overhead but I can
see the complication of two different sources for stats. Can you provide
the formula of system overhead? I am wondering why do you need to read
stats from memory.stat files. Why not the memory.current of top level
cgroups and /proc/meminfo be enough. Something like:

Overhead = MemTotal - MemFree - SumOfTopCgroups(memory.current)

I would say atmost 2 second stale instead of indeterministic.

Fix the in-kernel flushers separately. Also the problem Cloudflare is
facing does not need to be tied with this.

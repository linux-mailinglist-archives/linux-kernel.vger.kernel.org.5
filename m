It seems possible that some recent ASPM fixes could help this issue.
These fixes are not upstream yet, but should appear in v6.9-rc1.

Your (Michael's) bisection identified 08d0cc5f3426 ("PCI/ASPM: Remove
pcie_aspm_pm_state_change()"), which appeared in v6.0.  This was
intended to solve the problem of ASPM config changes made via sysfs
getting lost.

We removed 08d0cc5f3426 in v6.7 with f93e71aea6c6 ("Revert "PCI/ASPM:
Remove pcie_aspm_pm_state_change()"") to address the reboot after
resume problem that you reported.

e4dbf699467e ("PCI/ASPM: Update save_state when configuration
changes") is planned for v6.9-rc1 and should solve the same problem
08d0cc5f3426 tried to solve, but in a different way.

390fd84739c5 ("PCI/ASPM: Save L1 PM Substates Capability for
suspend/resume") is also planned for v6.9-rc1 and fixes some problems
with restoring L1 Substates config during resume.  These substates are
enabled for your 03:00.0 device, so this commit may also be related.

That's all a long way to say that I think testing v6.9-rc1 or later
(or linux-next as of Mar 7 or later) would be very interesting.

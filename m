It's a bit tricky that this particular option, that can support a 
comma-separated list, is shared between kernel and user space and user 
space does not already filter-out what is not relevant for it.

 From the perspective of needing xattr support in initramfs it's 
unfortunately not so obvious what the filesystem type of the kernel's 
rootfs (presumably the 1st file system) has to do with the option given 
for the 2nd filesystem. Though the Debian scripts are the bigger problem 
it seems. However, for those one could argue that the Debian scripts 
could be updated and for as long as they are not able to filter-out the 
tmpfs or ramfs options we are interested in one cannot pass these 
options or a comma-separated list on systems that run the current Debian 
scripts.

That's true unless you want to use IMA signature enforcement in the 
initramfs already and tmpfs is now required.

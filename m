Besides questionable code style (inline functions in the C file)...

...I think the patch is incomplete(?) due to misterious ways of PM runtime
calls. For example, in some cases we force runtime PM during system suspend
which may have an undesired effect of the switching pin control states
(hence glitches or some real issues with the hardware, up to hanging the
system). Some pins may be critical to work with and shuffling their states
in an unappropriate time can lead to a disaster.

So, I would consider this change okay if and only if it will have a detailed
research for all existing users to prove there will be no changes in the whole
set of possible scenarious (of system sleep / resume, runtime, runtime with a
custom ->prepare callback and so on).

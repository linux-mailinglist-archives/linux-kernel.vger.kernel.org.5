Yes, thanks

Good catch. It left from some older version. We use the existing
em_pd_mutex.

It is used in this patch, but inside the call_rcu() as 2nd arg.
I have marked that below. The compiler didn't complain IIRC.

We had a few internal reviews and there were voices where saying that
it's better to have 2 identical tables: 'default_table' and
'runtime_table' to make sure it's visible everywhere when it's used.
That made the need to actually have also the 'state' table inside.
I don't see it as a big problem, though.

Runtime table is only for driving the task placement in the EAS.

The thermal gov IPA won't make better decisions because it already
has the mechanism to accumulate the error that it made.

The same applies to DTPM, which works in a more 'configurable' way,
rather that hard optimization mechanism (like EAS).

The em_destroy_rt_table_rcu() is used here ^^^^^^

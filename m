Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker. Top-posting
for once, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

Just wondering what's up here. The patch this thread is about afaics was
supposed to fix a regression reported in July
(https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217680 ), but has made not
steps closer to get mainlined during the past few weeks. Is there a
reason, or did it maybe fell through the cracks?

Jiaxun Yang, from it quick look it seems like you wanted to post a v3,
but never did so; but I might be mistaken there.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

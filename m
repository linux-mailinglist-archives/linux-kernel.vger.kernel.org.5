So you are saying that the ICC core itself should get the bw values from DT
instead of hardcoding in the driver? If so, I'd like to get the opinion from
Georgi/Bjorn.

No, there is no confusion here, but a difference in perspective. Let's get the
thoughts of Georgi/Bjorn on this. I just want to avoid the confusion in DT since
some peripherals with OPP support will have bw defined in DT, while rest of the
peripherals will have them in drivers.

The idea is that having stats anywhere between 0-2 seconds stale is
inconsistent, especially when compared to other values (such as
memory.usage_in_bytes), which can give an inconsistent and stale view
of the system. For some readers, 2s is too spaced (we have readers
that read every second). A time-only bound is scary because on large
systems a lot can happen in a second. There will always be a delay
anyway, but ideally we want to minimize it.

I think 2s is also not a strict bound (e.g. flushing is taking a lot
of time, a flush started but the cgroup you care about hasn't been
flushed yet, etc).

There is also the problem of variable cost of reading.

I can't tell for sure to be honest, but given the continuously
increased number of cpus on modern systems, and the fact that
nr_cpus*MEMCG_CHARGE_BATCH can be localized in one cgroup or spread
across the hierarchy, I think it's better if we drop it for userspace
reads if possible.

I was hoping we can remove unified flushing completely, but stress
testing with hundreds of concurrent reclaimers shows a lot of
regression. Maybe it doesn't matter in practice, but I don't want to
pull that trigger :)

FWIW, with unified flushing we are getting great concurrency for
in-kernel flushers like reclaim or refault, but at the expense of
stats staleness. I really wonder what hidden cost we are paying due to
the stale stats. I would imagine any problems that manifest from this
would be difficult to tie back to the stale stats.

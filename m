I'm _very_ wary of mixing READ_ONCE() and plain loads to the same variable,
as I've run into cases where you have sequences such as:

	// Assume *ptr is initially 0 and somebody else writes it to 1
	// concurrently

	foo = *ptr;
	bar = READ_ONCE(*ptr);
	baz = *ptr;

and you can get foo == baz == 0 but bar == 1 because the compiler only
ends up reading from memory twice.

That was the root cause behind f069faba6887 ("arm64: mm: Use READ_ONCE
when dereferencing pointer to pte table"), which was very unpleasant to
debug.

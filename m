This is the exact reason why I made this series as RFC, because this is a open-ended problem.
The choices of 3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 are as arbitrary as the number of '10'. '1' and '2' is
definitely not suitable, because the seat has already been taken.

Take the drm/nouveau as an example:


```

MODULE_PARM_DESC(modeset, "enable driver (default: auto, "
		          "0 = disabled, 1 = enabled, 2 = headless)");
int nouveau_modeset = -1;
module_param_named(modeset, nouveau_modeset, int, 0400);

```


'1' is for enable the drm driver, some driver even override the 'nomodeset' parameter.

'2' is not suitable, because nouveau use it as headless GPU (render-only or compute class GPU?)

'3' is also not likely the best, the concerns is that
what if a specific drm driver want to expand the usage in the future?


The reason I pick up the digit '10' is that


1) The modeset parameter is unlikely to get expanded up to 10 usages.

Other drm drivers only use the '-1', '0' and 1, choose '2' will conflict with drm/nouveau.
By pick the digit '10', it leave some space(room) to various device driver authors.
It also helps to keep the usage consistent across various drivers.


2) An int taken up 4 byte, I don't want to waste even a single byte,

While in the process of defencing my patch, I have to say
draft another kernel command line would cause the wasting of precious RAM storage.

An int can have 2^31 usage, why we can't improve the utilization rate?

3) Please consider the fact that the modeset is the most common and attractive parameter

No name is better than the 'modeset', as other name is not easy to remember.

Again, this is for Linux user, thus it is not arbitrary.
Despite simple and trivial, I think about it more than one week.

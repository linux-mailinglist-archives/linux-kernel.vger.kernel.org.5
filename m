It's not a terribly new mechanism ... filemap_map_pages() was added nine
years ago in 2014 by commit f1820361f83d

Understood.  I don't know the history of this, so I'm not sure if the
decision to not mark folios as accessed here was intentional or not.
I suspect it's entirely unintentional.

By the way, rather than inserting an explicit call to folio_set_accessed()
in filemap_fault(), change the filemap_get_folio() call to
__filemap_get_folio() and add FGP_ACCESSED to the fgp flags.

FWIW (just in case some of you might not be aware of this): Linus not
that long ago said this about regressions that are somewhat older:

"""
There's obviously a time limit: if that "regression in an earlier
release" was a year or more ago, and just took forever for people to
notice, and it had semantic changes that now mean that fixing the
regression could cause a _new_ regression, then that can cause me to
go "Oh, now the new semantics are what we have to live with".
"""

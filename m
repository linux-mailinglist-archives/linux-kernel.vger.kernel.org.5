Hi Alex,

Agree. 

If we could introduce a "new vmalloc_fault()" function before accessing the kernel stack,
which would trigger an SFENCE.VMA instruction, then each time we call vmalloc() or vmap()
to create new kernel mappings, we wouldn't need to execute flush_cache_vmap() or
arch_sync_kernel_mappings() to update the TLB. This should be able to balance both
performance and correctness.

If there are no others reporting this issues, I believe encountering this TLB flush problem
might not be so common. Perhaps we could wait until you've finished implementing the
"new vmalloc_fault()" feature. If anyone encounters problems in the meantime, I think they
can temporarily apply either my patch or yours to workaround the issue of updating TLB for
vmalloc.

Best regards,
Dylan Jhong

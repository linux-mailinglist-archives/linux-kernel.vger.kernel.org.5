I don't know what linear map is, but I'll take your word for it that
endpoints are allowed to cache things internally.  So I guess in the
ideal world there might be a way for a driver to specify no-snoop for
accesses to its device if it knows there is no caching.

The commit log for this patch refers to caching on the *host*, though,
and IIUC you're saying this patch clears NO_SNOOP on TLPs from the RC
because of potential coherency issues on the *endpoint*.

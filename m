Thanks for writing this up, from my perspective this is very useful.

Some trivial feedback follows.

Perhaps this was discussed earlier.
But I'm curious to know if there is a preference for putting
this into staging rather than networking or elsewhere.

> +This document serves as a guide to the best practices, or cautions, for parsing user-space-provided Netlink attributes in kernel space. The intended audience is those who want to leverage the powerful Netlink interface (mainly for classic or legacy Netlink and the general Netlink users basically don't worry about these, see penultimate section) in their code. Additionally, for those who are curious about the parsing of Netlink attributes but may feel apprehensive about delving into the code itself, this document can serve as an excellent starting point.

I think it is normal to linewrap rst documentation.
At <80 columns would be best IMHO.

> +So what is a Netlink attribute? In simple terms, **the Netlink attribute is the structural payload carried by the Netlink message in TLV (Type-Length-Value) format** (At least it is suggested to do so). One can straightly read the comment and the code in ``include/net/netlink.h`` (most of the below content is derived from there). The following graph demonstrates the structure for the majority of messages.

Suggestion:

* straightly -> directly; or, perhaps better
  one can straightly -> one can

> +
> +The term **majority** is used here because the structure is dependent on the specific Netlink family you are dealing with. For example, the general Netlink family (NETLINK_GENERIC) puts ``struct genlmsghdr`` in the Family Hdr location and is strictly followed by specified Netlink attributes TLV. Differently, the connector Netlink family (NETLINK_CONNECTOR) does not use Netlink attributes for transiting the payload, but straight places naked data structure after its family header ``struct cn_msg``. In general, when working with Netlink-powered code, most developers opt for Netlink attributes due to their convenience and ease of maintenance. This means is definitely okay to overlook the corner cases which may eventually be incorporated into Netlink attributes in the future.

Suggestions:

* "Differently, the connector"
  -> As a counter example, the connector"

* "but straight places naked data structure after its family header"
  -> "but, rather, places a naked data structure immediately after its
      family header"

To process these attributes, the kernel code needs to locate the specific attribute and extract the payload from it, a process known as attribute parsing. This procedure can be tedious and error-prone when done manually, so the interface provides parsers to simplify the process.

If you have a pointer to a Netlink message, specifically a (\ ``struct nlmsghdr *``\ ), it's likely that you'll want to call the ``nlmsg_parse`` function. The prototype for this function is as follows:

Suggestions:

  * Else -> Otherwise,
  * "could be your choices" -> "may  be used"

Rest assured that the parsers will take care of clearing the buffer by calling memset, so you don't need to worry about any dirty data.  After the parsing, parsers will store the parsed pointer in the provided array, allowing you to easily access the parsed data later on.  For clarity, you can refer to the example below to see how the parsed result is organized.

> +The Linux kernel's attribute parsing mechanism is notably flexible, enabling attributes to be presented in any order, regardless of their specific type (e.g., ``EXAMPLE_4`` can precede ``EXAMPLE_2``). This flexibility is not always the case in other Netlink implementations, such as FreeBSD, where attributes may be required to follow a specific order.

With that said, let's move on to the tips and tricks for working with Netlink attributes.

Furthermore, although the nla_type is ``EXAMPLEA_2`` as exptected, the nla_len is ``0``, rather than the expected ``sizeof(u16)``, in the malformed packet.

Nit: exptected -> expected

> +
> +The access code erroneously believes the parsed attribute has a valid length, leading to out-of-attribute access. This has serious consequences, as it causes the heap of dirty data to be loaded into the variable ``val``\ , which can be stored in a global state and accessed from user space. This leakage of heap information can be exploited by a skilled attacker using Heap Feng Shui, then gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially allowing them to bypass protections like KASLR or SLAB_HARDEN.
> +
> +To prevent such a problem from occurring, it's essential to verify the attribute before attempting to access it. For instance, we can modify the example code as follows:

> +.. code-block:: c
> +
> +   u16 val;
> +   if (tb[EXAMPLEA_2] \
> +       && nla_len(tb[EXAMPLEA_2]) >= sizeof(u16)) // length check

> +
> +The code mistakenly assumes that the ``nla`` has a length of ``XXX``\ , leading to out-of-attribute access that potentially copies dirty data to the ``buffer``\ . However, ``nla_memcpy`` is immune to such bugs because it internally calls ``nla_len`` to ensure that only data within the boundary is copied. This also underscores the importance of #1 best practice.
> +
> +While the length check, which ensures the attribute has enough data to be accessed by `nla_get_u16`, is a good starting point, it's not the most efficient approach to perform such checks extensively throughout the code. Moreover, there are other important factors to consider beyond data length, such as value ranges, when determining the validity of an attribute. In reality, data length is just one of the basic aspects we need to examine.

Suggestion: reality -> practice

> +

> +
> +There are two ways to employ ``nla_policy``: pass the policy to the parser, which will validate the parsing process (see the ``policy`` parameter in those parsers), or actively call validation helpers like ``nlmsg_validate`` and ``nla_validate`` to check the attributes. The first option is generally preferred because it ensures that the pointer in the parsed destination array points to a valid attribute that can be safely accessed, eliminating the need for an additional check. Here's an example:
> +
> +.. code-block:: c

> +   if (tb[EXAMPLEA_2]) // if not NULL, already pass the policy length check
> +       val = nla_get_u16(tb[EXAMPLEA_2]);  // safe
> +
> +In addition to ``NLA_U8``\ , there are several other defined types, such as ``NLA_BINARY`` and ``NLA_STRING``, that can be used to prepare a nla_policy. However, two attributes deserve special attention: ``NLA_NESTED`` and ``NLA_NESTED_ARRAY``. These attributes are used to validate complex structures that contain nested elements, and they are particularly useful when dealing with hierarchical data structures. For instance, we can define a ``nla_policy`` for the Foo example above using these attributes.

> +``nla_policy`` by no means make the validation clean and graceful hence should be employed first than manual checks. The general Netlink interface allows the user to specify the policy for each handler and finish the validation before calling it, we will talk more about this next section.

Nit: by no means make the validation -> by no means makes the validation

> +
> +While using ``nla_policy`` is generally straightforward and recommended, there are some important considerations to keep in mind.
> +
> +First and foremost,, **Don't forget to complement the nla_policy when a new attribute type is introduced**. There are cases when developers, no matter for classic Netlink or general Netlink interfaces, make such mistakes. If the parsing does not follow the strict mode (which will be discussed in #3), such a mistake will result in the out-of-attribute access bug.

Nit: ,, -> ,

Suggestion: complement -> update

> +
> +Second, **Perform manual checks for manual parsing**. Examine the kernel code, readers can find cases that prepare ``nla_policy`` in a unconventional manner like below.

> +
> +The attribute ``IFLA_BOND_ARP_IP_TARGET`` is defined with the ``NLA_NESTED`` type, but without a nested ``nla_policy``. While it may seem logical to one to allow nested validation for this attribute, the answer is, unfortunately, no. The code employs an undocumented and sophisticated approach to organizing attributes, where the array index is embedded within the attribute type. Currently, there is no validation mechanism available to handle such a case.

Suggestion: "the answer is, unfortunately, no"
            -> "unfortunately, it is not"

> +``NLA_POLICY_NESTED`` is just one of many helpful tools at your disposal. If you're looking to validate the value range of an attribute, consider using ``NLA_POLICY_RANGE``\ , ``NLA_POLICY_MIN``\ , and ``NLA_POLICY_MAX``\ . And if you need to perform a strict length check, ``NLA_POLICY_EXACT_LEN`` is your best bet. Simply assigning a value to len in nla_policy will ensure that the attribute length is greater than or equal to your expected value, without strictly equaling it.
> +
> +#3 Embrace and take advantage of the strictness
> +-----------------------------------------------
> +
> +In the previous section, we talked about **strict mode**, which is related to the last best practice we'll discuss. While reading through the helpers declared in ``include/net/netlink.h``\ , readers may have noticed some of them have the ``_deprecated`` suffix, such as ``nla_parse_deprecated`` and ``nlmsg_parse_deprecated``. These deprecated functions are still widely used in the kernel, with over 300 call sites. This raises some questions: why are they marked as deprecated? What's the difference between them and the non-deprecated versions? And how do we choose between them?
> +
> +These deprecated functions in question were introduced in commit **8cb081746c03 ("netlink: make validation more configurable for future strictness")**, which aimed to enhance the configurability of parsing strictness. This commit split the parsing strictness into several options, as detailed in the commit message.
> +
> +* TRAILING     - check that there's no trailing data after parsing attributes (in message or nested)
> +* MAXTYPE      - reject attrs greater than max known type
> +* UNSPEC       - reject attributes with NLA_UNSPEC policy entries
> +* STRICT_ATTRS - strictly validate attribute size
> +
> +and one more option follows up later
> +
> +* NESTED       - strictly validate ``NLA_F_NESTED``
> +
> +After the aforementioned commit, the code now features three distinct levels of strictness: Liberal, Deprecated Strict, and Strict. By examining the code, it becomes readily apparent which options are employed by each level.
> +
> +.. code-block:: c
> +
> +   enum netlink_validation {

> +
> +The ``NL_VALIDATE_UNSPEC`` is an interesting one that deserves a note. In the previous part, a buggy case caused by forgetting to complement the policy is mentioned. Specifically, such a case only occurs when using the deprecated level. If choosing the latest strict level, which enables the ``NL_VALIDATE_UNSPEC`` option, such a case can be prevented as the newly added attribute type will be directly rejected due to the absence of the policy. This is a compelling reason to use the modern strict level instead of the older ones.

Suggestions:

* The ``NL_VALIDATE_UNSPEC`` is an interesting one that deserves a note.
  -> ``NL_VALIDATE_UNSPEC`` is interesting and deserves a note.

* complement -> update

> +
> +While the benefits of using ``NL_VALIDATE_STRICT`` are clear, simply replacing all deprecated parsers with this new option could result in compatibility issues due to the fact that older user space code may not follow a strict implementation. To address this concern, Johannes Berg, the author of the aforementioned commit, proposed a subsequent commit **56738f460841 ("netlink: add strict parsing for future attributes")**, which introduces a new field, strict_start_type, in the struct nla_policy structure. This new field allows for the definition of a "boundary type" for legacy code that utilizes deprecated parsers, thereby ensuring compatibility with older code while still providing the benefits of strict parsing.

Suggestions:

* "proposed" -> "provided"
* It may be useful to provide an example of use of this feature

> +The aforementioned content primarily presents best practices based on the author's experience with classic Netlink. However, these practices may not be relevant or could potentially cause confusion when working with new code that employs general Netlink. In the following section, we will explore how users of general Netlink can address these concerns and identify additional considerations that need to be taken into account.

> +In contrast to the classic implementation, which primarily involves registering a callback function, general Netlink utilizes the ``genl_split_ops`` structure (or ``genl_ops``, ``genl_small_ops`` depending on the situation) to provide additional details such as privileges, concurrency, and more. In the example mentioned above, when the ``policy`` and ``maxattr`` are known, the Netlink core will perform validation and parsing tasks before invoking the ``doit`` callback.
> +
> +As a result, the general Netlink user inadvertently follows the second best practice once they specify the ``policy`` field. Furthermore, in the case of modern families where the specification is generated (see `Netlink spec C code generation <https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/netlink/c-code-gen.html>`_ ), the problem of forgetting to complement the ``nla_policy`` should never occur. This feature is incredibly beneficial as it enhances maintainability. It is highly recommended to incorporate it into your Netlink code.

Suggestion: complement -> update

> +
> +However, the general Netlink user should still consider the #1 and #3 best practices as areas of concern.
> +
> +About the first best practice, regardless of the interface you are currently working with, it is essential to handle Netlink attributes and make use of the available helpers. definitely don't forget the helper ``nla_memcpy``.

Suggestions

* About -> Regarding
* definately -> In particular,
* the helper ``nla_memcpy`` -> the ``nla_memcpy`` helper

> +
> +Regarding the third best practice, general Netlink employs a modern strictness approach by default for parsing, utilizing the user-provided policy and maxattr, which is perfect. However, for the sake of flexibility (and compatibility), the interface also allows users to specify ``GENL_DONT_VALIDATE_STRICT`` if they prefer a more liberal strictness. Additionally, there are additional validate flags available, see ``genl_validate_flags`` enum.
> +
> +.. code-block:: c
> +

> +    };
> +
> +To be honest, the developer should avoid those ``DONT`` flags as possible. However, the ``GENL_DONT_VALIDATE_STRICT`` flag, which enables liberal strictness, is used over 400 times in the Linux kernel code. This observation suggests that a significant portion of the codebase has not fully adopted modern strictness principles yet.

> +
> +Summary
> +=======
> +
> +This document provides an overview of the data structure and parsers for Netlink attributes, along with three best practices for parsing these attributes. The parsing discussed in this document only applies to the "RX channel" (most ``doit`` functions), where the kernel needs to parse user space-provided Netlink messages. The opposite channel, where the kernel prepares Netlink messages for user space (most ``dumpit`` functions), is not covered in this document as it is considered less prone to implementation errors.
> +
> +The first best practice is "use provided helper to parse and access nlattr", which can make the parsing easier and increase the code maintainability. The second one is "never access nlattr without checking", otherwise an out-of-attribute access bug could occur. The last one is "embrace and take advantage of the strictness", which has been a topic of discussion since 2019 but has yet to be fully adopted.
> +
> +An extra section is used to discuss the general Netlink interface case. Fortunately, this interface has evolved rapidly, becoming safer and safer. The latest general Netlink allows for the generation of specifications and policy automatically from YAML, with the generated policy defaulting to modern strictness. However, users still have to concern about the #1 and #3 practices when dealing with the attributes.
> +
> +It's important to note that correctly parsing Netlink attributes is only the first step but definitely not the last step to keep your code away from the bugs.

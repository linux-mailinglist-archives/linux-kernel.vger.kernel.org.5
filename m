Bus Master Enable controls the ability of a Function to issue Memory
and I/O Read/Write Requests (PCIe r6.0, sec 7.5.1.1.3).  PTM uses
Messages, and I don't think they should be affected by Bus Master
Enable.

I also don't understand the I225 connection.  We have these
Uncorrected Non-Fatal errors:

They are clearly Unsupported Request errors caused by PTM Requests
(decoding at https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216850#c9),
but they were logged by 00:1d.0 and 04:01.0.

The hierarchy is this:

  00:1d.0 Root Port to [bus 03-6c]
  03:00.0 Switch Upstream Port to [bus 04-6c]
  04:01.0 Switch Downstream Port to [bus 06-38]
  06:00.0 Switch Upstream Port to [bus 07-38]
  07:04.0 Switch Downstream Port to [bus 38]
  38:00.0 igc I225 NIC

If I225 sent a PTM request when it shouldn't have, i.e., when 07:04.0
didn't have PTM enabled, the error would have been logged by 07:04.0.

The fact that the errors were logged by 00:1d.0 and 04:01.0 means that
they were caused by PTM requests from 03:00.0 and 06:00.0.

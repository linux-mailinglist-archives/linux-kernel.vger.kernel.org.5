Even simpler:
	rcu_read_lock();
	memcg = mem_cgroup_from_task(current);
---------
	Here the task can be moved to another memcg and the previous one
	can be offlined, making objcg fully detached.
---------
	for (; memcg != root_mem_cgroup; memcg = parent_mem_cgroup(memcg)) {
		objcg = rcu_dereference(memcg->objcg);
		if (objcg && obj_cgroup_tryget(objcg))
---------
	Objcg can be NULL here or it can be not NULL, but loose the last reference
	between the objcg check and obj_cgroup_tryget().
---------
			break;
		objcg = NULL;
	}
	rcu_read_unlock();

I'll come back with some numbers, hard to speculate without it. In this case
the majority of savings came from not bumping and decreasing a percpu objcg
refcounter on the slab allocation path - that was quite surprising to me.

Yep.

Maybe, but then the question is if it really worth it. In the final version
the update path doesn't need a spinlock, so it's quite cheap and happens
once on the first allocation, so Idk if it's worth it at all, but I'll take
a look.

I think the bigger question I have here (and probably worth a lsfmmbpf/plumbers
discussion) - what if we introduce a cgroup mount (or even Kconfig) option to
prohibit moving tasks between cgroups and rely solely on fork to enter the right
cgroup (a-la namespaces). I start thinking that this is the right path long-term,
things will be not only more reliable, but we also can ditch a lot of
synchronization and get better performance. Obviously not a small project.

Thanks!

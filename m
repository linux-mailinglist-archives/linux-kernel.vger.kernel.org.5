Reparenting has been the behavior since the first iteration of cgroups
in the kernel. The initial implementation would loop over the LRUs and
reparent pages synchronously during rmdir. This had some locking
issues, so we switched to the current implementation of just leaving
the zombie memcg behind but neutralizing its controls.

Thanks to Roman's objcg abstraction, we can now go back to the old
implementation of directly moving pages up to avoid the zombies.

However, these were pure implementation changes. The user-visible
semantics never varied: when you delete a cgroup, any leftover
resources are subject to control by the remaining parent cgroups.
Don't remove control domains if you still need to control resources.
But none of this is new or would change in any way! Neutralizing
controls of a zombie cgroup results in the same behavior and
accounting as linking the pages to the parent cgroup's LRU!

The only thing that's new is the zombie cgroups. We can fix that by
effectively going back to the earlier implementation, but thanks to
objcg without the locking problems.

I just wanted to address this, because your description/framing of
reparenting strikes me as quite wrong.

The series is a follow-up and contains all patches of the previous
series "mtd: ubi: behave like a good MTD citizen"[1] which was meant in
preparation for implementing the NVMEM provider.

The goal is to support embedded Linux devices which got NVMEM bits
stored inside a UBI volume. Representing the UBI volume in the Device
Tree, adding a phandle to be referenced by NVMEM consumers allows such
devices to come up with their correct MAC addresses and device-specific
Wi-Fi calibration data loaded.

In order to be available for other drivers, attaching UBI devices has
to be moved from late_initcall (which is too late for other drivers) to
happen earlier. As an alternative to the existing kernel cmdline
parameter the Device Tree property 'compatible = "linux,ubi";' inside
an MTD partition can be used to have that MTD device attached as UBI
device. MTD partitions which serve as UBI devices may have a "volumes"
firmware subnode with volumes which may be compatible with
"nvmem-cells".

In this way, other drivers (think: Ethernet, Wi-Fi) can resolve and
acquire NVMEM bits using the usual device tree phandle, just this time
the NVMEM content is read from a UBI volume.

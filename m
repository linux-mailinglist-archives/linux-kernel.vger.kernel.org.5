This seems much better :)

In the current code, the execution is as follows:

	ks_pcie_probe()
	    dw_pcie_host_init()
	        pci_host_probe()
	            ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus()

Moving the contents of ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus() to ks_pcie_msi_host_init()
will result in:

	ks_pcie_probe()
	    dw_pcie_host_init()
	    	if (pci_msi_enabled())
			if (pp->ops->msi_init) {
				ret = pp->ops->msi_init(pp);
					ks_pcie_msi_host_init()
	        pci_host_probe()

I will update this patch based on your suggestion. If it's alright, may I
also add your "Suggested-by" tag for the v5 patch? Please let me know.

Thank you for clarifying.

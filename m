That would indeed be asking for it.  But then again, they might have set
a breakpoint elsewhere that had the unintended side-effect of catching
the RCU grace-period kthread right at that point.

If that isn't something we are worried about, your original is fine.
If it is something we are worried about, I recommend learning from my
RCU CPU stall warning experiences and just using a lock.  ;-)

Yes.

Two observations:

(1) The current do_linkat() has a bug when the caller passes
    AT_EMPTY_PATH with an absolute path. In that case getname_uflags()
    will handle this fine and ignore AT_EMPTY_PATH but do_linkat() will
    perform the capable() check even though the path isn't empty. 
(2) io_uring uses do_linkat() but doesn't actually support AT_EMPTY_PATH
    because it calls getname(), not getname_flags(). Maybe that's
    intentional. In any case, it would need a separate patch for
    io_uring to enable that functionality.

I think for your case you need something like the below where you bubble
up whether the path is empty from getname_flags() and pass that to
do_linkat() which can then perform the privilege check only for the case
where the source path is actually empty. That will also fix (1).

(not even compile tested)

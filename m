You can see that error flags being set in the controller and endpoint,
for example, using lspci -vv:

	CESta:  RxErr- BadTLP+ BadDLLP- Rollover- Timeout- AdvNonFatalErr-

I haven't tried that, I'm just reporting that that piece of
functionality is currently broken and that that partly explains why the
ASPM problems went unnoticed.

Further errors as in further correctable errors that are not related to
the errors seen when resetting the X13s Wi-Fi link at boot.

These show up, for example, when accessing the NVMe on the CRD or when
using the Wi-Fi on the X13s. These errors go away when L0s is disabled.

And yes, you see them with both the external and internal MSI controller
(in the latter case, by looking at the error flags mentioned above).

Well, we don't know yet where the problem lies, just that enabling L0s
results in a large number of correctable errors.

Until yesterday I had not seen any such errors for the Wi-Fi on the CRD,
which uses essentially the same ath11k controller, so there was no clear
indication that this was necessarily a problem with the devices either.

Did you have any particular benchmark in mind?

I have run multiple fio benchmarks and while the results vary with the
parameters, the impact of switching to ITS (so that not all PCIe
interrupts are processed on CPU0) is generally favourable.

A raw sequential read shows no change in throughput on either the X13s
or the CRD even if for some reason this test performs really badly on
the X13s (i.e. regardless of which MSI controller is used):

	crd-rseq-read:	IOPS=11.1k, BW=2764MiB/s (2898MB/s)(81.0GiB/30003msec)
	X13s-rseq-read:	IOPS=508, BW=127MiB/s (134MB/s)(3841MiB/30169msec)

Another benchmark I've used against a mounted ext4 partition shows a 2x
improvement in throughput with ITS for sequential and random reads and
writes on the X13s:

	seq-read:	IOPS=88.4k, BW=345MiB/s (362MB/s)(10.0GiB/29657msec)
	rand-read:	IOPS=21.2k, BW=82.8MiB/s (86.8MB/s)(4967MiB/60001msec)
	seq-write:	IOPS=162k, BW=632MiB/s (662MB/s)(10.0GiB/16213msec)
	rand-write:	IOPS=142k, BW=555MiB/s (582MB/s)(10.0GiB/18439msec)
	
while the results are essentially unchanged with a larger block size and
queue depth (32/2m instead of 4/4k):

	seq-read:	IOPS=1095, BW=2191MiB/s (2298MB/s)(10.0GiB/4673msec)
	rand-read:	IOPS=1020, BW=2041MiB/s (2140MB/s)(10.0GiB/5017msec)
	seq-write:	IOPS=918, BW=1837MiB/s (1926MB/s)(10.0GiB/5574msec)
	rand-write:	IOPS=826, BW=1653MiB/s (1734MB/s)(10.0GiB/6194msec)

No, this patch has beeen created and evaluated from scratch based on the
downstream direwolf dts, which has these five 'msi-map' properties. 

I debated whether I should base it on your version instead, but in the
end it would have a new commit message and only these properties from
the downstream dtsi would remain (you also removed existing properties
IIRC). So while it's certainly inspired by your work, this has been done
from scratch, including the testing.

If you prefer I can make this clear in the commit message, but adding a
Co-developed-by didn't seem quite right either as I did this work
without your involvement. But perhaps that would be better?

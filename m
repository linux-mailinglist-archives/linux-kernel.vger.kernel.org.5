I think the problem is we aren't setting the fwnode, just the of_node
ptr, but I haven't had a chance to verify that.

But you don't. The logic to find the interrupt parent is walk up the
parent nodes until you find 'interrupt-parent' or
'#interrupt-controller' (and interrupt-map always has
#interrupt-controller). So your overlay just needs 'interrupts =3D <1>'
for INTA and it should all just work.

That of course implies that we need interrupt properties in all the
bridges which I was hoping to avoid. In the ACPI case, for DT
interrupt parsing to work, we're going to need to end up in an
'interrupt-controller' node somewhere. I think the options are either
we walk interrupt-map properties up to the host bridge which then
points to something or the PCI device is the interrupt controller. I
think the PCI device is the right place. How the downstream interrupts
are routed to PCI interrupts are defined by the device. That would
work the same way for both DT and ACPI. If you are concerned about
implementing in each driver needing this, some library functions can
mitigate that.

I'm trying to play around with the IRQ domains and get this to work,
but not having any luck yet.

Seems fragile as you have to know something about the parent (the # of
cells), but you don't have the phandle. If you needed multiple
entries, you couldn't parse this.

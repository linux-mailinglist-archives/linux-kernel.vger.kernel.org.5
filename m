I think this makes good sense, but let me make sure I understand how
this works.

I *think* what's happening is that this Function 0 responds to config
reads, so PCI enumeration starts by discovering it normally.  But
after 6fffbc7ae137 ("PCI: Honor firmware's device disabled status"),
we abort in pci_setup_device() if the DT or ACPI status is "disabled,"
which means there's no struct pci_dev for it, no quirks can run on it,
and no driver can bind to it.  And, since PCI multi-function devices
must have a Function 0, we don't enumerate the other functions of this
device.

That's a problem because (1) you need to do some initialization on
Function 0 even though you don't want a driver to claim it, and (2)
this is a multi-function device and you need to enumerate the other
functions.

What this patch does is make it so the PCI core enumerates Function 0
normally so there will be a struct pci_dev for it, the normal config
space access to it will work, and it will appear in the dmesg log and
lspci output, all as usual.  But if the DT or ACPI status is
"disabled", we will not bind a PCI driver to it.

If that's true, I'd like to highlight the PCI details here and move
some of the device-specific things to the driver patches, e.g.,
something like this:

  PCI: Enumerate device but don't bind driver if firmware status is 'disabled'

  In some configurations, the NXP LS1028A has a multi-function NIC
  where Function 0 is not usable as a NIC, but it's accessible via
  config space and it's needed for device-specific initialization.
  Function 0 also indicates that the NIC is a multi-function device
  and the kernel should look for more functions.

  arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/fsl-ls1028a.dtsi marks Function 0 as
  "disabled," and after 6fffbc7ae137 ("PCI: Honor firmware's device
  disabled status"), Linux doesn't enumerate Function 0, which means
  the entire NIC is unusable because Linux doesn't enumerate the other
  functions either.

  Instead of completely ignoring a function with DT/ACPI "disabled"
  status, enumerate it as usual but prevent drivers from claiming it.
  The disabled function will still be accessible via config space,
  fixups will work, and it will be visible via lspci.

So feel free to merge this along with the other patches via the net
tree with:

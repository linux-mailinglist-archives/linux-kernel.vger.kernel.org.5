There was a PCI SIG discussion about this a few years ago that never
really seemed to get resolved:
https://members.pcisig.com/wg/PCIe-Protocol/mail/thread/35064

Unfortunately that discussion is not public, but the summary is:

  Q: How is the LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD value determined?

     PCIe r5.0, sec 5.5.4, says the same value must be programmed into
     both Ports.

     A: As noted in sec 5.5.4, the value is determined primarily by
	the amount of time it will take to re-establish the common
	mode bias on the AC coupling caps, and it is assumed that the
	BIOS knows this.

  Q: How are the LTR Max Snoop values determined?

     PCI Firmware r3.3, sec 4.6.6, says the LTR _DSM reports the max
     values for each Downstream Port embedded in the platform, and the
     OS should calculate latencies along the path between each
     Downstream Port and any Upstream Port (Switch Upstream Port or
     Endpoint).

     Of course, Switches not embedded in the platform (e.g., external
     Thunderbolt hierarchies) will not have this _DSM, but I assume
     they should contribute to this sum?

     A: The fundamental problem is that there is no practical way for
	software to discover the AC coupling capacitor sizes and
	common mode bias circuit impedance.

	Software could compute conservative values, but they would
	likely be 10x worse than typical, so the L1.2 exit latency
	would be significantly longer than actually required to be.

	The interoperability issues here were understood when
	designing L1 Substates, but no viable solution was found.

So the main reason Puranjay's work got stalled is that I didn't feel
confident enough that we understood how to do this, especially for
external devices.

It would be great if somebody *did* feel confident about interpreting
and implementing all this.

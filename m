If you have a way to get to the struct pci_dev * which you're waiting for
in qi_submit_sync() then I guess you could check for its presence and bail
out if it's gone, instead of issuing a cpu_relax().

Even though user space may have initiated orderly removal via sysfs,
the device may be yanked from the slot (surprise removed) while the
orderly removal is happening.

If you could provide a stacktrace for a contemporary kernel,
I think that would be preferred.

Why is it fixed in v6.7-rc4?  Is the present patch thus unnecessary?

I'm just pointing out the preferred way to write commit messages
in the PCI subsystem (as I've perceived it over the years) so that
you can reduce the number of iterations you have to go through
due to maintainer feedback.  I'm just trying to be helpful.

I'd say adhere to the 1 min + 50% number provided in the spec.

If you know the device is gone before that then you can break out
of the loop in qi_submit_sync() of course.

The question is, does the Intel IOMMU have a timeout at all for
Invalidate Requests?  I guess we don't really know that because
in the stack trace you've provided, the watchdog stops the machine
before a timeout occurs.  So it's at least 12 sec.  Or there's
no timeout at all.

If the Intel IOMMU doesn't enforce a timeout, you should probably amend
qi_submit_sync() to break out of the loop once the 1 min + 50% limit
is exceeded.  And you need to amend the function to sleep instead of
polling in interrupt context.

Can you check with hardware engineers whether there's a timeout?

Thanks,

Lukas

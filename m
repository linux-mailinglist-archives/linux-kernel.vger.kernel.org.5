Yes, we should not ignored this situation.

Yes, the proposal can prevent us from writing the wrong timing.
However, as things stand, we have to do the waiting in host controller driver now.
We will keep the wait for the link, but don't return error when the link is down,
such as:
    if (starfive_pcie_host_wait_for_link(pcie))
	dev_info(dev, "port link down\n");

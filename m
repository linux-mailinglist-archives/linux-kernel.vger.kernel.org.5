Thanks for doing that!  That seems to explain the mystery.

You could hack the test to get an idea of how many successful
iterations there are before getting an error.

For SDHCI, one difference between tuning and re-tuning is the
setting of bit-7 "Sampling Clock Select" of "Host Control 2 Register".
It is initially 0 and then set to 1 after the successful tuning.
Essentially, leaving it set to 1 is meant to speed up the re-tuning.
You could try setting it to zero instead, and see if that helps.
e.g.

diff --git a/drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c b/drivers/mmc/host/sdhci.c
index c79f73459915..714d8cc39709 100644

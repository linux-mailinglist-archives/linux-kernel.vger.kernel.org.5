It seems that the root cause here is that the bridge ports do not enter=20
D3cold but remain in D3hot because of an ACPI power resource that is=20
shared (with Thunderbolt in this case but that's just one example, there=20
could be other similar sharings outside of what PCI controls).

There is an attempt to power off the entire hierarchy into D3cold on=20
suspend but the ports won't reach that state. Because the port remains in=
=20
D3hot, the config space is preserved and LBMS bit along with it.

So it seems that we cannot make the assumption that a device enters D3cold=
=20
just because it was suspended.


On the positive side, it was also tested that the logic fix I sent earlier=
=20
solved the most visible problem which is the delay on resume. It doesn't=20
address the false activation of Target Speed quirk because LBMS bit is=20
still set but the symptoms are no longer the same because of the=20
corrected logic.

So to solve the main issue with delay, there's no need to clear the LBMS=20
and the patch you're preparing/testing for pcie_failed_link_retrain()
together with the logic fix on its caller are enough to address the first=
=20
issue.

I still think those two should be put into the same commit because the
true <-> false changes, if made separately, lead to additional
incoherent states but if Bjorn wants them separately, at least they=20
should be put back-to-back so the brokeness is just within a single=20
commit in the history.

In addition, my 2nd patch addresses another issue which is unrelated=20
to this despite similar symptoms with extra delay on resume. I'll send v2=
=20
of that 2nd path separately with the inverted return value.

One point I'd be very interested to know if the link actually comes up=20
successfully (even if briefly) because this has large implications whether=
=20
the quirk can actually be invoked from the bandwidth controller code.

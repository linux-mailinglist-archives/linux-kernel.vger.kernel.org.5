Yes, that's how it is intended to work :/

Yes, but if we also change vma->file->f_ra->ra_pages during the
WILLNEED operation (as we do for FADV_SEQUENTIAL) then we get a
larger readahead window for the demand-paged access portion of the
WILLNEED access...

It gets limited by file->f_ra->ra_pages being initialised to
bdi->ra_pages and then never changed as the advice for access
methods to the file are changed.

But the problem here is *not the readahead code*. The problem is
that the user has configured the device readahead window to be far
smaller than is optimal for the storage. Hence readahead is slow.
The fix for that is to either increase the device readahead windows,
or to change the specific readahead window for the file that has
sequential access patterns.

Indeed, we already have that - FADV_SEQUENTIAL will set
file->f_ra.ra_pages to 2 * bdi->ra_pages so that readahead uses
larger IOs for that access.

That's what should happen here - MADV_WILLNEED does not imply a
specific access pattern so the application should be running
MADV_SEQUENTIAL (triggers aggressive readahead) then MADV_WILLNEED
to start the readahead, and then the rest of the on-demand readahead
will get the higher readahead limits.

> This patch changes 3) to use bdi->io_pages as readahead unit.

I think it really should be changing MADV/FADV_SEQUENTIAL to set
file->f_ra.ra_pages to bdi->io_pages, not bdi->ra_pages * 2, and the
mem.load() implementation in the application converted to use
MADV_SEQUENTIAL to properly indicate it's access pattern to the
readahead algorithm.

Cheers,

Dave.

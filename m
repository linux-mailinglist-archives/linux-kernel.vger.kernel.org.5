In your other mail you wrote:

Is this an independent worry or can the concurrent __sock_release()
issue only happen due to a sock_orphan() having happened first? I think
that it requires a sock_orphan() having happend, presumably because the
socket gets marked SOCK_DEAD and can thus be released via
__sock_release() asynchronously?

If so then taking sk_callback_lock() in owner_mt() should fix this.
(Otherwise we might need an additional get_active_file() on
sk->sk_socker->file in owner_mt() in addition to the other fix.)

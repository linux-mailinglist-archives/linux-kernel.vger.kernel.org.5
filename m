Still not getting across to you apparently.

Again, the code in question is exercised on every boot and not once have
I seen a stuck clock due to reset being asserted *in*
qcom_pcie_init_2_7_0().

Now that's not what you were trying to describe as you were thinking of
reset having been left asserted *before* the driver probes (or before
qcom_pcie_init_2_7_0() is called).

See? Do you understand now what I was trying to say and why my
misinterpretation of your terse commit message lead me to claim that it
was clearly false?

Yes, but you need to also say something about how this would happen, for
example, your hypothetical bootloader leaving it asserted and your actual
motivation for this change which is that it appears to be needed after
suspend. 

A commit message should be clear and self-contained and not force
reviewers to have to try to interpret what it means and guess what the
motivation for the change really is.

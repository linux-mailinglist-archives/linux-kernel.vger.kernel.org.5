Oh!
Okay, this makes a lot more sense. And that'll need a bit more
explanations in the commits & Documentation/ as you've concluded :)

My other hat is on embedded development (dayjob at Atmark Techno[1], the
only english page linked is about 4 years out of date but I guess it's
better than no page at all), so I can understand where you're coming
from -- thanks for the background.

That means I'll actually want to test this, but kind of always busy so
it might take a few weeks...
Or better, do you happen to know if qemu can create a USB controller
that supports OTG so it'll be easy to test for folks with no such
hardware?
We've got enough 9p protocols that aren't actually tested on a regular
basis, it'd be great if we could have something that can run anywhere.

Right, most host PCs won't have OTG available...
I was also perplexed by the linux foundation (0x1d6b):0x0109 id, that
might be clearer once it's properly documented -- I'll let someone from
the usb side chime on this as I have no idea what's appropriate.

Plenty of potential work ahead :)
Frankly at this stage I don't think it's much simpler than e.g. CDC
ethernet gadget and mounting nfs over tcp, but with further improvements
it can definitely get simpler.

(Yeah, I'm not actively looking for that -- was just asking because MTP
has been kind of dead lately and I'm not aware of any potential
alternative, but I didn't go looking for them either -- let's leave that
to later)

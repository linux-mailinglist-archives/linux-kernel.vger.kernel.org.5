Thanks, I changed that locally.

I added a hint here.

OK, I'll have to take your word for this.  I don't know enough about
PCIe to know what sort of periodic transmissions are required when a
device is idle.

LTR messages are required when endpoint service requirements change,
but I wouldn't expect those if the device is idle.

I'll try to get this into -next today or tomorrow.

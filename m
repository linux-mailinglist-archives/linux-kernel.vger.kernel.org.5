Agreed with your interpretation FWIW.

I'll mention it here, I've seen some broken IP out there where the card's
FSM (including busy-signalling) was dependent on the host providing the
CLK, can't remember which one it was, though.
Anyway for Kamal, it might be interesting to know if your host controller
autostops the CLK (which it is allowed to) during the busy-signalling and
if not stopping it also works around the problem.

The intent of the change is to avoid the deferred split queue lock contention,
and this is only a problem for anon folios; page cache folios are never split in
this way. My intention was to do the smallest change to solve the problem. I
don't see the value in reworking a much bigger piece of the code, making it more
complex, when its not going to give any clear perf benefits.

If there is concensus that this is _required_ in order to merge this series,
then I guess I'll bite the bullet and do it. But my preference is to leave it
for if/when a reason is found that it is actually bringing benefit.

I agree that it will be hard to come up with an elegant solution to this
problem.

These endpoint controllers that cannot do register accesses to their own
controllers' DBI/register space without the RC providing a refclock are
really becoming a pain... and the design and complexity of the PCI endpoint
APIs is what suffers as a result.

PERST could be asserted at any time.
So for your system to not crash/hang by accessing registers in the controller,
an EPF driver must be designed with great care to never do any register access
when it is not safe...

Perhaps the the EPF core should set the state (i.e. init_complete = false,
even before calling the deinit callback in EPF driver, and perhaps even add
safe-guards against init_complete in some APIs, so that e.g. a set_bar() call
cannot trigger a crash because PERST# is asserted.. but even then, it could
still be asserted in the middle of set_bar()'s execution.)


Looking at the databook, it looks like core_clk is derived from pipe_clk
output of the PHY. The PHY will either use external clock or internal clock.

4.6.2 DBI Protocol Transactions
it looks like core_clk must be active to read/write the DBI.

I really wish those controllers could e.g. change the clock temporarily
using a mux, so that it could still perform DBI read/writes when there is
not external refclk... Something like pm_sel_aux_clk selecting to use the
aux clk instead of core_clk when in low power states.
But I don't know the hardware well enough to know if that is possible for
the DBI, so that might just be wishful thinking...


Kind regards,
Niklas

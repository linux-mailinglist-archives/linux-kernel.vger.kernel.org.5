To be clear, this doesn't have a functional change given how the code
is going to be used, right?  It's really more of a cleanup with a goal
of making the code easier to understand.  If so, we should make this
explicit at the beginning of the commit description, as opposed to
putting it at the end.

In journalism this is referred to as "burying the lede"[1], where the
"lede" the most important/key piece of information.  In general, it is
desirable not to "bury the lede".  That is, the most important
information, including why people should care, and what this is doing,
at the beginning of the commit description (or article in the case of
journalsm).

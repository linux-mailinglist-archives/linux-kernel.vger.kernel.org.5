The problem in (1) is that first of all it's a behavioral change, we
start having explicit staleness in the stats, and userspace needs to
adapt by explicitly requesting a flush. A node controller can be
enlightened to do so, but on a system with a lot of cgroups, if you
flush once explicitly and iterate through all cgroups, the flush will
be stale by the time you reach the last cgroup. Keep in mind there are
also users that read their own stats, figuring out which users need to
flush explicitly vs. read cached stats is a problem.

Taking a step back, the total work that needs to be done does not
change with (2). A node controller iterating cgroups and reading their
stats will do the same amount of flushing, it will just be distributed
across multiple read syscalls, so shorter intervals in kernel space.

There are also in-kernel flushers (e.g. reclaim and dirty throttling)
that will benefit from (2) by reading more accurate stats without
having to flush the entire tree. The behavior is currently
indeterministic, you may get fresh or stale stats, you may flush one
cgroup or 100 cgroups.

I think with (2) we make less compromises in terms of accuracy and
determinism, and it's a less disruptive change to userspace.

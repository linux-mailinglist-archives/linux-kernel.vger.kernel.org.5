Some additional information, this judgment was introduced in
commit 8016e29f4362 ("ext4: fast commit recovery path") in v5.10-rc1,
at which point mb_regenerate_buddy() was called to regenerate the
buddy when it was found to be freeing a block that had already been
freed, so there was no problem. Until v5.11-rc1 commit 6bd97bf273bd
("ext4: remove redundant mb_regenerate_buddy()") removes the logic
to regenerate the buddy, it looks like the free space statistics will
remain wrong. If this normal scenario exists, perhaps buddy should
be regenerated here?

Thanks,

I just want to check my understanding here - I think the problem occurs for
PTE-mapped, PMD-sized folios as well as smaller-than-PMD-size large folios? Now
that I've had a look at the code and have a better understanding, I think that
must be the case? And therefore this problem exists independently of my work to
support swap-out of mTHP? (From your previous report I was under the impression
that it only affected mTHP).

Its just that the problem is becoming more pronounced because with mTHP,
PTE-mapped large folios are much more common?

Do we need a Fixes tag?

This looks sensible to me after thinking about it for a while. But I also have a
gut feeling that there might be some more subtleties that are going over my
head, since I'm not expert in this area. So will leave others to provide R-b :)

Thanks,

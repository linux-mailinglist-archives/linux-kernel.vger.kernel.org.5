How do you know? I ask because usually the only way I have visibility
there is when I break something. In traditional OpenFirmware, which
IBM PPC is, all PCI devices have a DT node because it's the firmware
telling the OS "these are the devices I discovered and this is how I
configured them".

> Based on previous discussions, OF_DYNAMIC should not be used here.

For the same reasons, I don't think the behavior should change based
on being dynamic. Now maybe the behavior when it's an ACPI system with
DT overlays has to change, but that's a problem for later. I don't yet
know if we'd handle that here somehow or elsewhere so that this node
looks like a normal DT system.

This should all work the same whether we've generated the nodes or
they were already present in the FDT when we booted.

I hope not. The flags tend to be hacks.

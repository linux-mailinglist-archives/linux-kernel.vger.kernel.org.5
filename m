It would be good to add a pointer to the spec here.  I think the
relevant section is PCIe r6.1 sec 7.5.3.18 which says:

 "Supported Link Speeds Vector - This field indicates the supported
  Link speed(s) of the associated Port."
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Obviously the associated port is upstream on a Switch Upstream Port
or Endpoint, whereas it is downstream on a Switch Downstream Port
or Root Port.

Come to think of it, what about edge cases such as RCiEPs?

I'm wondering if caching both is actually necessary.  Why not cache
just the intersection?  Do we need either of the two somewhere?

Might want to add an explanation what you're going to need this for,
I assume it's accessed frequently by the bandwidth throttling driver
in a subsequent patch?

Thanks,

Lukas

The current kernel has enough infrastructure to manage essential functions
related to hardware protection:
- The Device Tree specifies the source of interrupts for detecting
  under-voltage events. It also details critical system regulators and some
  of specification of backup power supplied by the board.
- Various frameworks within the kernel can identify critical hardware
  conditions like over-temperature and under-voltage. Upon detection, these
  frameworks invoke the hw_protection_shutdown() function.

If we're to implement a deadline for each shutdown call (as the requirement for
"time values" suggests?), then prioritization becomes essential. Without
establishing a shutdown order, the inclusion of time values might not be
effectively utilized.  Am I overlooking anything in this regard?

The root of the issue seems to be the choice of primary storage device.

All storage technologies - HDD, SSD, eMMC, NAND - are vulnerable to power
loss. The only foolproof safeguard is a backup power source, but this
introduces its own set of challenges:

1. Batteries: While they provide a backup, they come with limitations like a
finite number of charge cycles, sensitivity to temperature (a significant
concern in industrial and automotive environments), higher costs, and
increased device size. For most embedded applications, a UPS isn't a viable
solution.

2. Capacitors: A potential alternative, but they cannot offer prolonged
backup time. Increasing the number of capacitors to extend backup time leads
to additional issues:
   - Increased costs and space requirements on the PCB.
   - The need to manage partially charged capacitors during power failures.
   - The requirement for a power supply capable of rapid charging.
   - The risk of not reaching a safe state before the backup energy
     depletes.
   - In specific environments, like explosive atmospheres, storing large
     amounts of energy can be hazardous.

Given these considerations, it's crucial to understand that such design choices
aren't merely "hacks". They represent a balance between different types of
trade-offs.

Upon investigating the feasibility of a user space solution for eMMC
power control, I've concluded that it's likely not possible. The primary
issue is that most board designs don't include reset signaling for
eMMCs. Additionally, the eMMC power rail is usually linked to the
system's main power controller. While powering off is doable, cleanly
powering it back on isnâ€™t feasible. This is especially problematic when
the rootfs is located on the eMMC, as power cycling the storage device
could lead to system instability.

Therefore, any user space method to power off eMMC wouldn't be reliable
or safe, as there's no way to ensure it can be turned back on without
risking the integrity of the system. The design rationale is clear:
avoiding the risks associated with powering off the primary storage
device.

Considering these constraints, the only practical implementation I see
is integrating this functionality into the system's shutdown sequence.
This approach ensures a controlled environment for powering off the
eMMC, avoiding potential issues.

What you described applies to the case where the device is *quirky*, it
"is not functioning correctly" when the IOMMU is configured in DMA
translation mode.

But it could not be used in another case, as described above, where
IOMMU translation has performance impacts on the device's DMA
efficiency. This is a kind of a user policy and should not be achieved
through the "DT/APCI + def_domain_type" mechanism.

The iommu subsystem has provided a sysfs interface that users can use to
change the domain type for devices. This means that users can change the
domain type at their wishes, without having to modify the kernel
configuration.

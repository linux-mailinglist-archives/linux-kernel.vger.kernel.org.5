AFAICT, that problem only exists for binaries directly invoked
from shim. So that would be a problem for the boot loader (grub),
or a kernel image being booted directly without a bootloader
present.

For kernel binaries invoked indirectly by the boot loader, the
use of SBAT is currently optional. ie missing SBAT record would
be treated as success.

This was a pragmatic way to introduce SBAT support as it only
impacted grub at that time.

Once a distro starts adding SBAT to their kenrels too though, we
can forsee that they would like to enforce SBAT for the whole
boot chain, to prevent rollback to previously signed binaries
that lacked SBAT info.

This policy could be enforced per key though. eg require SBAT
for anything verified against the vendor key that's compiled into
shim, but not require SBAT for binaries verified with the MoK
entries.

The user specific MoK entries don't have such a compelling use
case for SBAT, since if they need to revoke old binaries, the
end users always have the easy fallback option of just rotating
their signing keys and switching out the enrolled key in MoK.

The choice of whether to mandate SBAT for binaries signed with
a MoK entry, could be set by the end user themselves at the time
their enroll their signing cert in the MoK DB.

With regards,
Daniel

Thanks for your reply.
I think the log header should be recorded in the super block of the log. 
Otherwise,
it is impossible to know whether the valid transactions are the ones 
scanned by
scanning the transactions in the log area.

I agree with your suggestion. I'll fix that in the next version.

The purpose of the check is to check whether there are consecutive 
transactions after the
commit block that is not completely committed. If yes, the data is damaged.

However, we need to pass the next_commit_ID and next_log_block values to the
jbd2_commit_block_csum_verify_partial() function for pr_notice().

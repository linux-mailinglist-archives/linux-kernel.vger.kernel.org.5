This is abysmal; IIRC TEO tracks a density function in C state buckets
and if it finds it's more likely to be shorter than 'predicted' by the
timer it should pick something shallower.

Given we have this density function, picking something that's <1% likely
is insane. In fact, it seems to suggest the whole pick-alternative thing
is utterly broken.

But given we have our density function, we should be able to do much
better.


Oooh,... I think I see the problem. Our bins are strictly the available
C-state, but if you run this on a Zen3 that has ACPI-idle, then you end
up with something that only has 3 C states, like:

$ for i in state*/residency ; do echo -n "${i}: "; cat $i; done
state0/residency: 0
state1/residency: 2
state2/residency: 36

Which means we only have buckets: (0,0] (0,2000], (2000,36000] or somesuch. All
of them very much smaller than TICK_NSEC.

That means we don't track nearly enough data to reliably tell anything
about disabling the tick or not. We should have at least one bucket
beyond TICK_NSEC for this.

Hmm.. it is getting very late, but how about I get the cpuidle framework
to pad the drv states with a few 'disabled' C states so that we have at
least enough data to cross the TICK_NSEC boundary and say something
usable about things.

Because as things stand, it's very likely we determine @stop_tick purely
based on what tick_nohz_get_sleep_length() tells us, not on what we've
learnt from recent history.


(FWIW intel_idle seems to not have an entry for Tigerlake !?! -- my poor
laptop, it feels neglected)

Furthermore the devres action for dwc_pcie_pmu_remove_cpuhp_instance() is apparently going for even more style points at module exit by not even relying on the corresponding .remove callback of the tenuous platform driver to undo what its .probe did, but (ab)using the device's devres list to avoid having to keep track of an explicit list of PMU instances at all.

Agreed - I hadn't it in my head that we didn't have a good mapping to a particular
PCIe device (based on some similarish hardware where the counters are shared across
multiple RPs) Here I guess it's fine to use the PCI device.

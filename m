In the kernel's point of view, they are supported.  It's just perf tool
not using them.  So I think we should say "Not used".

Considering -a option, it can be "ring buffers for selected CPUs".

I feel like this section contains kernel implementation details.

I think you should mention that AUXTRACE record is not a kernel ABI.
It's defined by perf tool to describe which portion of data in the AUX
ring buffer is saved.

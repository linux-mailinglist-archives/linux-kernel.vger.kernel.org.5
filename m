I added the "dyndbg=" option to the 5.15.139 kernel command line and booted. 
The resulting dmesg output has been attached to bugzilla 218268.

I also tested 5.15.139 with the "pci=realloc" kernel parameter.  This was
sufficient to allow the system to boot without a GPU initialisation failure.
The dmesg output from this boot has also been attached to bugzilla 218268.

I used kernel.org's 5.15.139 for these tests because I already had it
compiled and was a little short of time.  If you'd like me to repeat the
tests with a different kernel let me know which one and I'll see what I can
do.  The Christmas break may delay this somewhat.

I just gave it a shot and I could see the AER interrupts raised for correctable
errors with internal MSI controller.

Now I'm puzzled why this is not getting triggered by default. I'll check with
the hardware team if they have any clue.

I'll confirm the L0s compatibility with the hardware team.

Ok, this looks promising. Long back when I tried the benchmark (seq & rand r/w),
performance dropped slightly with GIC ITS. But looks like things have changed.

Nah. As I said, if you have created the patch without basing on my version,
then no credit is required. I just wanted to know since I shared the patch
earlier.

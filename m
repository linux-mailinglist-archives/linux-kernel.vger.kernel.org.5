I dumped the config space just before the readl() and it is:

BAR0 was configured with the value: 0x05500000 within ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus() at:
dw_pcie_writel_dbi(pci, PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_0, ks_pcie->app.start);
and can be verified based on the previous config space dump I had shared within
the pci_setup_device() function. But, looking at the dump above which is just
before the readl(), its value seems to have changed to 0x10100000.

I am listing down the regions of config space which have changed, based on the
comparison of dumps taken within pci_setup_device() and just before the readl():

Yes, PCI_PREF_MEMORY_BASE and PCI_PREF_MEMORY_LIMIT are writable.

PCI_IO_BASE and PCI_IO_LIMIT are also writable.

Yes, I think it is supposed to work, but it doesn't seem to be working right now
considering that even with Endpoint device connected, the readl() returns all Fs.

Right now, we are able to do isolcpus=domain with the isolated cpuset partition functionality. Other aspects of CPU isolation are being looked at with the goal of reducing the gap of what one can do at boot time versus what can be done at run time. It will certain take time to reach that goal.

rcu_nocb is already ready for that. The not yet ready part is nohz_full and its
several components (tick, remote tick, [hr-]timers affinity, workqueues affinity, kthreads
affinity, vmstat, buffer head, etc...). Last debate on plumbers suggested that
nohz_full should be dynamically turned on/off only on offline CPUs. That will
indeed simplify the problem.

Last time I tried that, Peter Zijlstra was more in favour of an isolate all or nothing
switch by default for nohz_full that would include rcu_nocb. And then if people
are interested in something more finegrained, introduce such a file to control
individual features (see
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/YpIwsiaY2IPK96WO@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net/ )

But so far I never heard about the need for such a finegrained isolation. Users of
nohz_full= seem to want to isolate everything out.

Thanks.

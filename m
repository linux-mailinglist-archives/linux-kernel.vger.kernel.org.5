I'm a bit confused about that one-off thing. What can trigger that timer
interrupt if it has been stopped?

One thing can happen though: a pending timer IRQ while we are stopping the
tick (IRQs are disabled in that idle loop portion). But then that pending timer
interrupt is not going to reprogram another one. So it remains stopped.

Thanks.

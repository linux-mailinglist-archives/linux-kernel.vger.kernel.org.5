Cool, will use multiplication directly.

Furthermore the devres action for dwc_pcie_pmu_remove_cpuhp_instance() is apparently going for even more style points at module exit by not even relying on the corresponding .remove callback of the tenuous platform driver to undo what its .probe did, but (ab)using the device's devres list to avoid having to keep track of an explicit list of PMU instances at all.

You are right.

Agreed, it might be more straightforward. But personally speaking, I prefer
current implementation.

    - standard driver creation / probe flow is more normal
    - it avoid maintaining list of PMU instances
    - IMHO, both of them are temporary solution, if PCI core addes a
      standard mechanism to discover and enbale PCIe VSEC/DVSEC capability,
      the driver will use the standard way.

Conversely if it isn't, why pretend to handle it being removed? Even if it's not to do with physical hotplug of the PMU but with the user unloading the PCI controller driver itself (since there's no module/driver-level dependency enforced) and thus tearing down the whole PCI bus, then the same point still applies - if that *can* happen, then what if the user then re-loads it again, or indeed if this module loads first to begin with; wouldn't we want to be able to (re-)discover the PMUs rather than leave the whole PMU driver degraded to a useless state?

I see you point, there are three casees:
1. hot-remove PCI root port firstly and then load the PMU module, the PMU
of the removed PCI device will not be registered.

I think it is the expected behavior.

2. load the PMU module firstly and then hot-remove PCI root port, the PMU
of the removed PCI device will be unregistered.

it is what the dwc_pcie_pmu_unregister_nb() does upon BUS_NOTIFY_DEL_DEVICE

3. load the PMU module firstly, hot-remove PCI root port, and then hot-plug
the PCI root port the PMU of the hot-pluged device will not load again by
current design upon BUS_NOTIFY_DEL_DEVICE.

I guess it is the really problem. It can be workaround be reload the PMU
module. It has been a bit complex around how the following interact:

    - Driver loading/unloading
    - CPU hotplug events
    - PCI device add/del events

We can also add action for BUS_NOTIFY_ADD_DEVICE to address the problem,

    - scan all PCI device
     - check RAS_DES cap
     - check cached PMU node
     - registers its PMU

But I prefer leave as it is, just as x86 does in uncore_bus_notify().
Certainly, if the community deems it necessary to implement
BUS_NOTIFY_ADD_DEVICE action, I also would like to extend it.

I'm not worried about the shrinker's general data. What I'm worried
about is the shrinker's private data. Except for the corresponding
developers, others don't know the meaning of the private statistical
data, and we have no control over the printing quantity and form of
the private data. This may indeed cause OOM log confusion and failure
to automatically parse. For this, any thoughts?

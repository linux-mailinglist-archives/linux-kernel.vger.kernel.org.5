I think Secondary status (PCI_SEC_STATUS) is always owned by the OS
and is not affected by _OSC negotiation, right?  Linux does basically
nothing with that today, but I think it *could* clear the "Received
Master Abort" bit.

I'm not very familiar with Advisory Non-Fatal errors.  I'm curious
about the UESta situation: why can't firmware know about UnsupReq
being set?  I assume PCI_ERR_COR_ADV_NFAT is the Correctable Error
Status bit the firmware *does* see and clear.

But isn't the whole point of Advisory Non-Fatal errors that an error
that is logged as an Uncorrectable Error and that normally would be
signaled with ERR_NONFATAL is signaled with ERR_COR instead?  So
doesn't PCI_ERR_COR_ADV_NFAT being set imply that some
PCI_ERR_UNCOR_STATUS must be set as well?  If so, I would think
firmware *could* figure that out and clear the PCI_ERR_UNCOR_STATUS
bit.

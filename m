I think the question here is around the for_each_pci_dev() in
__dwc_pcie_pmu_probe()?  I don't *like* that because of the
assumptions it breaks (autoload doesn't work, hotplug doesn't work),
but:

  - There are several other drivers that also do this,
  - I don't have a better suggest for any of them,
  - It's not a drivers/pci thing, so not really up to me anyway,

so I don't have any problem with this being merged as-is, as long as
you can live with the limitations.

I don't think this series does anything to work around those
limitations, i.e., it doesn't make up fake device IDs for module
loading or fake events for hotplug, so it seems like we could improve
the implementation later if we ever have a way to do it.

Bjorn

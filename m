To be completely honest I am not sure whether BPF is the right fit
myself. It is definitely a path to be explored but maybe we will learn
not the proper one in the end. The primary reason for considering it
though is that there is endless (+1) different policies how to select a
victim to kill on OOM. So having an interface to hook into and make that
decision sounds very promissing. This might be something very static
like EXPORT_SYMBOL that a kernel module can hook into or a more broader
BPF callback that could be more generic and therefore allow for easier
to define policy AFAIU.

Depends on your system.  It can also be identified, in the proper way,
as /dev/disk/by-uuid/eef0abc1-4039-4c3f-a123-81fc99999993 if you want
(note, fake uuid, use your own disk uuid please.)

Why not do that?  That's the most stable and recommended way of doing
things.

Not true at all, happens for many systems (think about how systems that
run their whole OS out of ram work...)

For your broken scsi driver, yes.

I don't want to add a new parameter that we need to support for forever
and add to the complexity of the system unless it is REALLY needed.
Please work with the scsi developers to resolve the issue for your
hardware, as it's been working for everyone else for well over a year
now, right?

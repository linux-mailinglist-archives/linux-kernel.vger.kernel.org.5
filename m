I was thinking before reclaiming enclave pages, if we know the untracked  
vepc pages (current-tracked) is larger than limit, we just return error  
without enforcing the limit. That way user also knows something is wrong.

But I get that we want to be able to kill VMs to enforce the newer lower  
limit. I assume we can't optimize efficiency/priority of killing: enclave  
pages will be reclaimed first no matter what just because they are  
reclaimable; no good rules to choose victim between enclave and VMs in  
your example so enclaves could be killed still before VMs.

So here are the steps I see now, let me know if this is aligned with your  
thinking or I'm off track.

0) when all left are enclave VA, SECS pages and VEPC in a cgroup, the OOM  
kill process starts.
1) The cgroup identifies a victim vepc for OOM kill(this could be before  
or after enclaves being killed), sets a new flag VEPC_NO_MEMORY in the  
vepc.
2) call sgx_vepc_remove_all(), ignore failure counts returned. This will  
perform best effort to eremove all normal pages used by the vepc.
3) Guest may trigger fault again, return SIGBUS in sgx_vepc_fault when  
VEPC_NO_MEMORY is set. Do the same for mmap.
4) That would eventually cause sgx_vepc_release() before VM dies or killed  
by user space, which does the final cleanup.

Q: should we reset VEPC_NO_MEMORY flag if #4 never happens and cgroup  
usage is below limit? I suppose we can do it, but not sure it is sane  
because VM would try to load as much pages as configured originally.

I'm still thinking about using one unreclaimable list, justification is  
simplicity and lack of rules to select items from separate lists, but may  
change my mind if I found it's inconvenient.

Not sure how age/youngness can be accounted for guest pages though Kai  
indicated we don't need that for first version. So I assume we can deal  
with it later and add separate list for vEPC if needed
for that reason.

Thanks a lot for your input.
Haitao

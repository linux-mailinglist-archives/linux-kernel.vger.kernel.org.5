I don't think you need a mutex.  Hence don't include the header either! :)

Sure, I spotted it was copied but doesn't mean I like that code either :)

No. That would be unwind for a devm_alloc_netdev() which doesn't
exist for the case where you want to override the manual version.

Here would be
static void kcs_bmc_mctp_free_netdev(void *priv)
{
	free_netdev(priv);
}

Ideally none at all once everthing has moved over to device managed (devm) based
handling.  The purpose of devm is to automatically call all the release functions
in reverse order of the setup calls (gets more complex but in this case it will
simply be reverse order).  That will occur on an error in probe() or after
remove() callback is called. Happens without the remove() callback as well which
is what we want here.

True - lots of examples elsewhere though :)

Some simple rules of thumb.

1. The first call in probe() that you make that does not have automated cleanup
   (so non devm_ * or you haven't manually added a cleanup callback via
    devm_add_action_or_reset()) ends devm usage in probe.
2. In remove() and in error paths in probe() don't do anything at all to cleanup
   stuff that was registered with devm_ calls as they will be automatically
   cleaned up for you.

In a simple driver it's often possible to move everything over to devm_ 
calls so there is no manual cleanup to do at all. If that's the case
don't provide a remove() callback.  However the subsystem may insist
on one in which case either fix that (they should be optional) or
provide an empty one.

Understood - should be able to do better than that though ;)

Allocations occur in probe just before register_netdev, so they should be
before free_netdev() for example.

Understood. Would need some experimenting to figure
out a path where it does something rather than it already
being disabled.

Yeah. That's bad :(  Seems devm being relied on for error paths, but not
remove()

That's annoying..  Could fix it by making it return an int so it
could report the failure it handles to the caller module instead
of always returning success...  That smells like a bug to me though
I haven't checked if the module_init() return value gets used
for anything much.

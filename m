Beware that even if HW does not support hotplug, endpoint PCIe card
still may drop the link down and later put it up (for example if FW in
the card crashes or when card want to do internal reset, etc...; this is
very common for wifi cards). So drivers for non-hotplug controllers
still have to handle hotplug events generated by link up/down state.

So it means that, if endpoint PCIe card is not detected during probe
time, it may be detected later. So this check to completely stop
registering controller is not a good idea. Note that userspace can
tell kernel (via sysfs) to rescan all PCIe buses and try to discover new
PCIea devices.

Rather to remove this starfive_pcie_host_wait_for_link logic.

Better option would be to teach PCI core code to wait for the link
before trying to read vendor/device ids, like I described in my old
proposal.

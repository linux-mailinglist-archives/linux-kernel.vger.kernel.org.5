Subject: [PATCH 00/10] arm64: dts: qcom: sc8280xp: enable GICv3 ITS for PCIe

This series addresses a few problems with the sc8280xp PCIe
implementation.

The DWC PCIe controller can either use its internal MSI controller or an
external one such as the GICv3 ITS. Enabling the latter allows for
assigning affinity to individual interrupts, but results in a large
amount of Correctable Errors being logged on both the Lenovo ThinkPad
X13s and the sc8280xp-crd reference design.

It turns out that these errors are always generated, but for some yet to
be determined reason, the AER interrupts are never received when using
the internal MSI controller, which makes the link errors harder to
notice.

On the X13s, there is a large number of errors generated when bringing
up the link on boot. This is related to the fact that UEFI firmware has
already enabled the Wi-Fi PCIe link at Gen2 speed and restarting the
link at Gen3 generates a massive amount of errors until the Wi-Fi
firmware is restarted.

A recent commit enabling ASPM on certain Qualcomm platforms introduced
further errors when using the Wi-Fi on the X13s as well as when
accessing the NVMe on the CRD. The exact reason for this has not yet
been identified, but disabling ASPM L0s makes the errors go away. This
could suggest that either the current ASPM implementation is incomplete
or that L0s is not supported with these devices.

Note that the X13s and CRD use the same Wi-Fi controller, but the errors
are only generated on the X13s. The NVMe controller on my X13s does not
support L0s so there are no issues there, unlike on the CRD which uses a
different controller. The modem on the CRD does not generate any errors,
but both the NVMe and modem keeps bouncing in and out of L0s/L1 also
when not used, which could indicate that there are bigger problems with
the ASPM implementation. I don't have a modem on my X13s so I have not
been able to test whether L0s causes an trouble there.

Enabling AER error reporting on sc8280xp could similarly also reveal
existing problems with the related sa8295p and sa8540p platforms as they
share the base dtsi.

The last four patches, marked as RFC, adds support for disabling ASPM
L0s in the devicetree and disables it selectively for the X13s Wi-Fi
and CRD NVMe. If it turns out that the Qualcomm PCIe implementation is
incomplete, we may need to disable ASPM (L0s) completely in the driver
instead.

Note that disabling ASPM L0s for the X13s Wi-Fi does not seem to have a
significant impact on the power consumption 

The DT bindings and PCI patch are expected to go through the PCI tree,
while Bjorn A takes the devicetree updates through the Qualcomm tree.

This series contains the several fixes, making drm/ci much
more reliable and useful.

Highlights:

* Current DRM/CI in drm-misc is broken, this series fixes it with mesa
  uprev (commit 1/9).

* The fails.txt and flakes.txt lists were generated by a bogus script,
  this series restart that initial list from scratch (commit 5/9),
  which reduced considerably the number of flakes.

* Jobs are run in a subset of available DUTs in the Lava farm
  (commit 6/9) to not block merge requests for Mesa3D.

* Add python script update-xfails.py to update the xfails lists
  (commit 3/9).

Tested on https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/helen.fornazier/linux/-/pipelines/1014358

To work properly, the following patches are also required:

[PATCH 2/2] drm/ci: force-enable CONFIG_MSM_MMCC_8996 as built-in
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-arm-msm/patch/20231008132320.762542-2-dmitry.baryshkov@linaro.org/

[PATCH] drm/ci: Enable CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/dri-devel/patch/20231002164715.157298-1-robdclark@gmail.com/

v3 changes:
- adjust timeout of i915 so jobs can pass
- small adjustments in the flakes list
- point requirements.txt to new ci-collate to fix flakes
- update to latest version of mesa to get the patch that disables bare-metal retries
- fix typos

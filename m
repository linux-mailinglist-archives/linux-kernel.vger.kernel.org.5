OK, so in summary, what seems to be happening here is that the SEV
init code in the decompressor looks for the cc blob table before the
on-demand mapping code is up, which normally ensures that any RAM
address is accessible even if it hasn't been mapped explicitly.

This is why the fix happens to work: the code only maps the array of
(guid, phys_addr) tuples that describes the list of configuration
tables that have been provided by the firmware. The actual
configuration tables themselves could be anywhere in physical memory,
and without prior knowledge of a particular GUID value, there is no
way to know the size of the table, and so they cannot be mapped
upfront like this. However, the cc blob table does not exist on this
machine, and so whether the EFI config tables themselves are mapped or
not is irrelevant.

But it does mean the fix is incomplete, and certainly does not belong
in generic kexec code. If anything, we should be fixing the
decompressor code to defer the cc blob table check until after the
demand mapping code is up.

If this is problematic, we might instead disable SEV for kexec, and
rely on the fact that SEV firmware enters with a complete 1:1 map (as
we seem to be doing currently). If kexec for SEV is needed at some
point, we can re-enable it by having it provide a mapping for the
config table array and the cc blob table explicitly.

There's more to it. If you look at DMA buffer allocations, they need
memory which is contiguous in DMA address space of the requesting
device, but we allocate buffers that are contiguous in physical address
of the CPU. This difference is in fact responsible for some of the odd
DMA address limits.

All hell breaks loose when you try to fix this properly. Instead, we get
away with the observation that physically contiguous memory regions
coincide with DMA contiguous regions on real-world systems. But if
anyone feels like starting from scratch, they could also take the extra
time to look at this part. ;-)

FWIW I'm not volunteering, or at least not this year.

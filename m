It would be architecturally possible to enable SNC mode on
a subset of CPU sockets. But there isn't a BIOS setup option
to do that. You either have SNC everywhere, or nowhere.

I prefer "SNC NUMA node" == "sub-NUMA node".

This version "NUMA node on which SNC has been enabled"
makes it sound like there is a control on a NUMA node
that can be switched.  The control is on the CPU socket.
That's often equivalent to a NUMA node, but Intel has
had CPUs in the past where this isn't the case (e.g.
Cascade Lake -AP and Cooper Lake).

Thanks for the review of the series. I've applied changes
to my local tree. Will post v7 of the series early next
week if no other reviews come in.

It's simply that we should clearly not attempt to migrate a PMU context (via invoking the hotplug callbacks) *after* the relevant PMU has already been unregistered, since that's liable to lead to some kind of use-after-free, and at best it's just a pointless waste of time anyway - if we've got to the point of unbinding the driver (or failing to probe at all), there should definitely not be any active events or other PMU state that needs updating.

Thanks for the clarification. I think this is the root reason
of the problem met on the hns3 pmu.

Thanks.

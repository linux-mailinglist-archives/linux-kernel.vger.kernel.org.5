OK, so you are worried about latencies on spike memory usage.

Does that mean you do not have enough head room for kswapd to keep with
the memory demand? It is really hard to discuss this without some actual
numbers or more specifics.

This suggests that your LMKD doesn't pick up the right victim to kill.
And I suspect this is a fundamental problem of those pro-active oom
killer solutions.

This would suggest that MADV_PAGEOUT is really what you are looking for.
If you really aim at compressing a specific type of memory then tweking
reclaim to achieve that sounds like a shortcut because madvise based
solution is more involved. But that is not a solid justification for
adding a new interface.

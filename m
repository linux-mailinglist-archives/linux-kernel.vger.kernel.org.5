Hi Andrew,

Yes, I wasn't aware of the 100 lines limit, and yes, this is not a bug fix,
but an improvement (optimisation).

I think by this I can join to consensus, this patch is not a candidate for
backporting. :-/

However, I am concerned about the possibility of two kernel threads accessing
the RTL NIC intermittently attempting to program the NIC over the RTL_(R|W)(8|16|32)
instructions (which are expanded to readl/writel and assembly).

AFAICS, nothing prevents two (or more) threads to decide in unlikely but
possible case to program the card at the same time. (Do we have a guard lock
against this?)

mac_ocp_lock appears to be acquired and released for each RTL_(R|W)(8|16|32),
with the exception of r8168_mac_ocp_modify().

To be true to the facts, each byte will go to the right port due to address/data
pairs used in each call - however, I am worried whether there could be a scenario
like this:


        CPU 1                                          CPU 2

    start programming NIC
    programming NIC
    (preempted in spin_lock_irqsave()
                                                   start programming NIC
					          programming NIC
					          programming NIC
					          programming NIC
					          preempted in spin_lock_irqsave()
    (resume control in spin_unlock_irqrestore()
    programming NIC
    programming NIC
    (preempted in spin_lock_irqsave()
					          continue programming NIC
					          programming NIC
					          programming NIC
						  end programming NIC
    (resume control in spin_unlock_irqrestore()
    programming NIC
    end programming NIC

Now, every byte, word or longword will come to the right place, thanks to
RTL_(R|W)(8|16|32) having the address/data pairs - but I worry that this
jumping from sequence to sequence might confuse the NIC.

I mean, if those latches behind the addresses cause some physical effect, maybe
the ORDER is also important, not just that every byte, word or longword comes
to the right address?

r8168_mac_ocp_read()/r8168_mac_ocp_write() guarantee that every piece of
data will end being read or written at the right address, OK. But this
does not seem to guarantee the SEQUENTIAL ORDER of the programming.

I mean, if we are dealing with physical hardware like a NIC, the order
of (especially writing) data might be crucial. 8-/

Am I making any sense?

Are we algorithmically secured that two threads will never attempt to
write data to NIC hardware registers?

Thanks.

Best regards,
Mirsad Todorovac

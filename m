I'll copy my message from v1 regarding the IP-core version. Are you
really sure that it's 4.90a? Here is what my DW PCIe RC
_v4.90_ HW databook says about the BARs:

"Base Address Registers (Offset: 0x10-x14) The Synopsys core does not
implement the optional BARs for the RC product. This is based on the
assumption that the RC host probably has registers on some other
internal bus and has knowledge and setup access to these registers
already."

You cited the next text:

"3.5.7.2 RC Mode. Two BARs are present but are not expected to be
used. You should disable them or else they will be unnecessarily
assigned memory during device enumeration. If you do use a BAR, then
you should program it to capture TLPs that are targeted to your local
non-application memory space residing on TRGT1, and not for the
application on TRGT1. The BAR range must be outside of the three
Base/Limit regions."

AFAICS from the v5.20a, v5.30a, v5.40a databooks, it resides in the
_v5.x_ databooks only meanwhile the older ones (v4.21, v4.60a, v4.70a
and _v4.90a_) describe the BARs as I cited earlier. It makes my
thinking that in your case the IP-core isn't of 4.90a version. Could
you please clarify how did you detect the version? Did you use the
PCIE_VERSION_NUMBER_OFF register available in the PORT_LOGIC CSRs
space? If your judgment was based on the Keyston PCIe driver code,
then the driver might get to be wrong in that matter.

1. IMO defining two versions of the pci_ops struct instances would look
more readable:
static struct pci_ops ks_pcie_v3_65_ops = {
        .map_bus = dw_pcie_own_conf_map_bus,
        .read = pci_generic_config_read,
        .write = pci_generic_config_write,
        .add_bus = ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus,
};

static struct pci_ops ks_pcie_ops = {
        .map_bus = dw_pcie_own_conf_map_bus,
        .read = pci_generic_config_read,
        .write = pci_generic_config_write,
};

2. In case of 1. implemented, ks_pcie_ops will look the same as
ks_child_pcie_ops, so the later could be dropped.

3. I'm not that fluent in the PCIe core details, but based on the
pci_host_bridge.child_ops and pci_host_bridge.ops names, the first
ones will be utilized for the child PCIe buses, meanwhile the later
ones - for the root bus only (see pci_alloc_child_bus()). Bjorn?
If so then the pci_is_root_bus() check can be dropped from the
ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus() method. After doing that I would have also
changed the name to ks_pcie_v3_65_add_root_bus(). In anyway I would
double-check the suggestion first.

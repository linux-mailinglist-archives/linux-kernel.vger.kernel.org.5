Just a minute, this is wrong.  I was talking to Peter after all of this
blew up about how we handle signed kernels with no sbat (since we need
that still to work for developers who sign their own kernels).  I
thought he was planning to require an sbat section for all EFI
binaries, but he says that's not true.  The current way shim does the
sbat check is that if the section doesn't exist the binary is processed
as having an empty sbat section (i.e. no sbat level checking will be
done because there's no named sbat level for anything and it will just
work) and they're planning to keep it that way so that a signed but no
sbat kernel will always "just work" without any special key handling in
shim.  So if we're planning to keep this no-sbat case in discrete
kernels, even when the shim verifier checks sbat, the UKI kernel will
need to work for this case as well.

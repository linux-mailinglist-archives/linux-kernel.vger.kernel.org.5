Well, my job is to be concerned about how individuals who want to own
their own keys, either in MoK or db, participate in this, so I am
mostly thinking about local signing.  Whatever we decide, there must be
a local workflow pathway.

There is a thought to get sbat adopted by UEFI to solve the dbx
problem, but if that were to happen, UEFI will likely be extremely
concerned about backward compatibility (and as you have remarked, they
and the OEMs adopt at a glacial pace), so, even if they eventually
adopt it, I can't foresee them mandating refusing to execute signed EFI
binaries with no sbat.  I'll pretty much stake cash on the compromise
being that for the foreseeable future no sbat gets revoked by dbx and
the plan will be a gradual shift towards sbat ... but all this is
contingent on UEFI adoption in the first place, which isn't a given. 
There are also unsolved problems around sbat, like how the master sbat
lists are kept and how they're delivered which must be solved before a
UEFI proposal could be made.

Is the question, "Why do x1e80100 and sc8280 don't have hs_phy_irq ?"
If so, I checked the SC8280 HW specifics and I see one small error. The 
name was printed wrong. I got it from another source. Will move sc8280 
to list having 5 interrupts. As per x1e80100, I wasn't able to get my 
hands on the hw specifics and I followed the following link by Abel Vesa:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20231214-x1e80100-usb-v1-1-c22be5c0109e@linaro.org

As per the above patch, x1e80100 had only 4 interrupts.
For ipq5332, it has no hs_phy_irq and so I kept it under this section.

I will try to split it up, but not sure if it is a good idea. I say so 
because all permutations should be added in single patch and I can't 
split that.

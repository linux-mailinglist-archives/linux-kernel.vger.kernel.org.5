What I mean is that if your simple patch was adopted,
then the classic way of controlling a fork would fail.

	pid = fork()
        ^--------------- Would return 0 for both parent and child
        ^--------------- Look at pid_nr_ns to understand.
        if (!pid() {
		/* child */
		do_something();
		_exit(0);
	}
	waitpid(pid);

For your use case there are more serious problems as well.  The entire
process hierarchy built would be incorrect.   Which means children
signaling parents when they exit would be incorrect, and that parents
would not be able to wait on their children.

I do understand the desire to want to cow the memory space of all of the
processes.  That can potentially save a lot of resources.

In other checkpoint/restart scenarios people have been using userfaultfd
to get a similar benefit.

I suggest you look at the CRIU project.

Eric

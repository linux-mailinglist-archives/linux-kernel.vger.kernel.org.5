OK, I should have been more explicit. Let me expand. Charges are
accounted only _after_ the actual allocation is done. So the actual
allocation is not constrained by the memcg context. It might reclaim
from the memcg at that time but the disruption could have already
happened. Not really any different from regular memory allocation
attempt but much more visible with GB pages and one could reasonably
expect that memcg should stop such a GB allocation if the local reclaim
would be hopeless to free up enough from its own consumption.

Makes more sense?

With the later point I meant to say that the memcg OOM killer will not
communicate the hugetlb request failure so the usual SIGBUS will be
returned to the userspace. I can imagine a SIGBUS handler could check
hugetlb availability to retry or something similar.

Personally, I would respond "I'm sorry, but the only advertising
space we offer are Copyright headers (for employees) and
"user+customer@..." or "name (customer) user@..." (for contractors).

And this is a separate tag, so it's harder for the analysis tools
(whose output your customers must be interested in, too?) to
match the tag to the actual Author/Reviewer/...

> If I am the customer I'd really prefer the first option.

You are aware this will cause lots of work for the customer, too?

This is also causing more work for maintainers: now they have to check
if any Sponsored-by tags are present, and track if there is a response
with a matching Acked-by tag...

And obviously they should postpone applying the patch until a
confirmation response is sent... which may never happen...

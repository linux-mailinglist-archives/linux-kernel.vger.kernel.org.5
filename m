Unfortunately I have to agree with Johannes, Tejun and others who are not big
fans of this approach.

Lazy recharging leads to an interesting phenomena: a memory usage of a running
workload may suddenly go up only because some other workload is terminated and
now it's memory is being recharged. I find it confusing. It also makes hard
to set up limits and/or guarantees.

In general, I don't think we can handle shared memory well without getting rid
of "whoever allocates a page, pays the full price" policy and making a shared
ownership a fully supported concept. Of course, it's a huge work and I believe
the only way we can achieve it is to compromise on the granularity of the
accounting. Will the resulting system be better in the real life, it's hard to
say in advance.

Thanks!

I think you are misunderstanding me.

I think this patch is fine, except for the comment that I gave:
"Perhaps add a comment here stating WHY this is needed for v3.65a (!is_am6)."

Like:

/*
 * This is only needed for !am654 since it has its own msi_irq_chip
 * implementation. (am654 uses the generic msi_irq_chip implementation.)
 */
if (!ks_pcie->is_am6) {
	...
}


In fact, if you move this code to ks_pcie_msi_host_init(), instead of
ks_pcie_host_init(), you would not need a comment (or a if (!ks_pcie->is_am6)),
since ks_pcie_msi_host_init() is only executed by !am654.




My suggestion to split this driver to two different drivers is just because
I noticed how different they are (am654 has iATUs, uses generic msi_irq_chip
implementation and has EP-mode support. !am654 has no iATUs, its own MSI
implementation and no EP-mode support.)

So the am654 driver would look like most other DWC glue drivers.
The non-am654 driver would look mostly like it looks today, except you would
remove the EP-mode support.

However, this suggestion can of course be implemented sometime in the future
and should not be a blocker for the patch in $subject.


Kind regards,
Niklas

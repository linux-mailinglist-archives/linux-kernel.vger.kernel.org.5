Yeah, mutex_is_locked() is not a sufficient check - and mutexes have no 
implicit refcount properties like spinlocks. Once you call a mutex API, you 
have to guarantee the lifetime of the object until the function returns.

I.e. entering a mutex_lock()-ed critical section cannot be used to 
guarantee that all mutex_unlock() instances have stopped using the mutex.
I agree that this is a bit unintuitive, and differs from spinlocks.

I've clarified all this a bit more in the final patch (added a 'fully' 
qualifier, etc.), and made the changelog more assertive - see the attached 
patch.

Thanks,

	Ingo

Subject: [PATCH] locking/mutex: Document that mutex_unlock() is non-atomic

I have seen several cases of attempts to use mutex_unlock() to release an
object such that the object can then be freed by another task.

This is not safe because mutex_unlock(), in the
MUTEX_FLAG_WAITERS && !MUTEX_FLAG_HANDOFF case, accesses the mutex
structure after having marked it as unlocked; so mutex_unlock() requires
its caller to ensure that the mutex stays alive until mutex_unlock()
returns.

If MUTEX_FLAG_WAITERS is set and there are real waiters, those waiters
have to keep the mutex alive, but we could have a spurious
MUTEX_FLAG_WAITERS left if an interruptible/killable waiter bailed
between the points where __mutex_unlock_slowpath() did the cmpxchg
reading the flags and where it acquired the wait_lock.

( With spinlocks, that kind of code pattern is allowed and, from what I
  remember, used in several places in the kernel. )

Document this, such a semantic difference between mutexes and spinlocks
is fairly unintuitive.

[ mingo: Made the changelog a bit more assertive, refined the comments. ]

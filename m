It's not a random location, but a location where the full path and/or
unit-address are not known. What we should know is the node's base
name and compatible.

I think we can assume for this kind of usecase, that adding nodes only
under a defined base node is allowed. This is also just the
restriction I've asked for every time more general support of applying
overlays by the kernel is requested. The add-on card, hat, cape, etc.
usecases should all be applied downstream of some node.

Note that "/" is also a valid target path. I think it would be better
to have a form that's obviously not a fixed path. I think what's
needed is to be able to specify just the nodename with or without the
unit-address. I don't know if dtc will accept that.

As labels are part of the ABI with overlays, a target label could also
work. Though the kernel would have to learn to add new labels or get a
label path from another source as a label doesn't exist on a generated
node.

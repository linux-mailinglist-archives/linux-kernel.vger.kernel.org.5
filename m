Firstly, it's worth mentioning that LEA is an encryption algorithm =
designed to ensure 128-bit security.

The LEA cipher provides a balance between code size and required memory, =
allowing for trade-offs with performance. The implementation of LEA that =
we have submitted is oriented towards achieving optimal performance.

While it's difficult to compare to the most recent implementations of =
cryptographic algorithms because the test is out of date, you can see =
the results of a previous FELICS test [1] that implemented LEA for a =
smaller code size.

For example, a detailed example of skipping the key schedule to reduce =
memory usage and minimize code size can be found in [2].

Thank you for your interest.

Why would 'signing tools' handle that? It's just a text-based PE
section, it doesn't require access to private key materials to be
handled, nor it has any relationship with signing. Why should all the
(numerous) signing tools be extended to do also add arbitrary PE
sections? And again, the point is that it's not something you might or
might not want to have - if you are getting your Shim signed by the
3rd party CA, you need it, full stop, end of story. Without it, you
don't boot. So it needs to be easy to find and consume for all the
distributions/groups/projects that participate in the Shim + 3rd party
CA workflow, that's the main goal. Mistakes are going to be expensive.

The kexec question is indeed interesting, but a bit further down the
road. As James said, initially protecting the stub is probably more
interesting and urgent, as the system before ExitBootServices is much
more "valuable" to protect. For the future, IIRC a few ideas were
floated, to avoid downgrades, but nothing concrete as far as I know.

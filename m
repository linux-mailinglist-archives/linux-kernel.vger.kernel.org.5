Thank you for testing all this!

I see, but having a higher temperature defined in the second active
thermal trip is exactly the trick that should make cooling setups
  more quiet.  More precisely, the intention is to define a dual-trip
configuration that should make as many different active cooling setups
as quiet as possible, simply because some active cooling setups (and
some CPU loads) may result in crossing the second trip's temperature
less frequently than with the other setups.

I'd much rather have two active thermal trips defined, simply because
a beefier heatsink, with much larger fin surface, may completely change
the behavior of the Rock 5B's active cooling.  Radxa already sells a
much larger heatsink, linked below, to which a fan can rather easily be
attached, or a fan can be used to provide some airflow inside the case
into which the board is mounted.

In other words, having two active thermal trips at 55 oC and 65 oC does
not hurt the acoustics and the thermal performance of the active
cooling setup you're using, compared with having just one active trip
at 65 oC, while the dual-trip configuration can help with other active
cooling setups that are different from yours.  It's a win-win.

I hope you agree.

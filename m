Bah, so why has this worked at all then? Clearly the linkers aren't very
strict about things.

Anyway, I think what we want is to just mark the section SHF_ALLOC. The
reason is that one of the plans we have is to collapse all the different
annotations into a single section and then have something like:

	struct objtoo_annotation {
		s32 location;
		u32 type;
	}

So that we can easily extend the annotations and don't need to add
yet-another-section-reader-function to objtool.

This is just one of the things we've not gotten around to yet. But as
is, we have:

	.discard.unreachable
	.discard.reachable
	.discard.func_stack_frame_non_standard
	.discard.ignore_alts
	.discard.unwind_hints
	.discard.noendbr
	.discard.retpoline_safe
	.discard.instr_end
	.discard.instr_begin
	.discard.validate_unret
	.discard.intra_function_calls

And with the exception of unwind_hints, they're all just trivial
location things.

The very last thing we need is yet more of that.

If we were to use absolute things, we get 12 byte entries and while that
probably wouldn't spell the end of the world, why make thing larger than
they have to be.

After all, its not like any of this actually survives the final link.

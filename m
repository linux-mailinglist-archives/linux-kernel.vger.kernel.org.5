Sorry let me clarify. This is in reference to deciding how we want the 
dwc3 driver to behave in system_suspend case.

One option is to continue with the existing behavior where USB gadget 
would disconnect from Host irrespective of bus suspend state. We dont 
need any modification in this case and we can leave this series limited 
to runtime suspend only.

Second option is to stay connected IF we are in bus suspend state 
(U3/L2) otherwise DISCONNECT IF we are not in bus suspend state. The 
main motivation is to preserve the ongoing usb session
without going through a re-enumeration (ofcourse true only if we are in 
bus suspend state). This would need relevant checks in suspend_common().

Which option do you think is more suitable? IMO option2 is better. For 
example if we are in a scenario where there is a network session (over 
USB) open between Host and the device and usb bus is suspended due to 
data inactivity. Option2 would preserve the session whereas Option1 we 
would terminate this session when a system_suspend happens.

Thanks
Elson

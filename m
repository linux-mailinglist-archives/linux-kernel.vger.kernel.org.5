So think this way. By having these open coded we can check in detail
that the feature works exactly how we would like.

Those tools add an abstraction layer which makes it harder to evaluate
this as a whole.

Also, that renders away all possible issues related to different
versions of 3rd party tools and their possible incompatibilities.

If pure bash for some reason would turn out to be unmanageable nothing
prevents to e.g. implement a small tool in C or Python that does the
tasks required. E.g. for testing TPM2 chips I implemented custom TPM2
user space just for kselftest, and in SGX we implemented "bare metal"
enclave implementation with the same rationale.

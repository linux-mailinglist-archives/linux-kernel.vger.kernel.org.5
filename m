And why can't the FULL preempt setting still use the NEED_RESCHED_LAZY?
PREEMPT_RT does. The beauty about NEED_RESCHED_LAZY is that it tells you
whether you *should* schedule, or you *must* schedule (NEED_RESCHED).

In my first email about this:

  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231024103426.4074d319@gandalf.local.home/

I said:

  If we are worried about abuse, we could even punish tasks that don't call
  sched_yield() by the time its extended time slice is taken.

To elaborate further on this punishment, if we find that it does become an
issue if a bunch of tasks were to always have this bit set and not giving
up the CPU in a timely manner, it could be flagged to ignore that bit
and/or remove some of its eligibility.

That is, it wouldn't take too long before the abuser gets whacked and is no
longer able to abuse.

But I figured we would look into that if EEVDF doesn't naturally take care
of it.

My guess is that NEED_RESCHED_LAZY will work with PREEMPT as well. That
code is still a work in progress, and this code is dependent on that. Right
now it depends on PREEMPT_AUTO because that's the only option that
currently gives us NEED_RESCHED_LAZY. From reading the discussions from
Thomas, it looks like NEED_RESCHED_LAZY will eventually be available in
CONFIG_PREEMPT.

I'll go back and read that.

User space spin locks would most definitely run differently in RT/DL today!

That could cause them to easily deadlock.

User space spin locks only make sense with SCHED_OTHER, otherwise great
care needs to be taken to not cause unbounded priority inversion.
Especially with FIFO.

And that is what user space adaptive spin locks are to solve, which I'm
100% all for! (I'm the one that talked Andr√© Almeida into working on this).

But as my tests show, the speed up is from keeping the lock holder from
being preempted. The same is true for why Thomas created NEED_RESCHED_LAZY
for PREEMPT_RT when it already had adaptive spin locks.

OK, so the timestamps told us how long the watchdog tolerates.  I
don't know how useful that is.  I suspect that's not a fixed interval
(probably differs by watchdog and possibly user preference).

Call it a "quick workaround" then, not a "fix".  I'm personally not
usually interested in quick workarounds that are not actually fixes,
but the IOMMU folks would be the ones to decide.

Maybe this is more of an optimization?  If patch 4/4 is a real fix (in
the sense that if you disable the watchdog, you would get correct
results after a long timeout), maybe you could reorder the patches so
4/4 comes first, and this one becomes an optimization on top of it?  I
haven't worked though the whole path, so I don't know exactly how
these patches work.

If the other IOMMU drivers are vulnerable, I guess they would like to
fix this at the same time and in a similar way if possible.

s/safe_removal/safe removal/ (they are not a single word)
s/suprise_removal/surprise removal/ (misspelled, also not a single word)

Needs to be in the commit log, of course.

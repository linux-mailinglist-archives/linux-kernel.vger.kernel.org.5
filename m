Yes, the initial idea is to use thread local storage (TLS). It seems to
be the fastest option to save a per-thread value that changes at a fast
rate.

You are getting the idea. A slot or tag for a thread would be great! I'm
not a fan of overriding the thread comm name (as that already has a
use). TLS would be fine, if we could also pass an offset + size + type.

Maybe a stack slot that just points to parts of TLS? That way you could
have a set of slots that don't require much memory and selectively copy
them out of TLS (or where ever those slots point to in user memory).

When I was talking to Mathieu about this, it seems that rseq already had
a place to potentially put these slots. I'm unsure though how the per
thread aspects would work.

Mathieu, can you post your ideas here about that?

Agree about the fs/gs possibly being used for other things. If we had a
stack slot we could avoid the confusion and have tighter couplings.

You can do this in eBPF (see [2]). However, it's very clunky and depends
on specific SDKs per-language/runtime. We ourselves don't run our profilers
with anything other than CAP_PERFMON, and also have environments without
BPF enabled due to various reasons. It'd be great if we could get this data
directly from perf. At the very least, I'd love to get a standardized
way to attribute thread values accessible to other performance systems
(like eBPF and perf).

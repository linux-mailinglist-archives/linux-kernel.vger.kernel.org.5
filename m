In mainline, the ofl variable is defined as cpu_is_offline(cpu), and
during boot, the boot CPU is guaranteed to be online.  (As opposed to
the boot CPU's idle-task state.)

Once per RCU Tasks Trace grace period per reader seen to be blocking
that grace period.  Its performance is as issue, but not to anywhere
near the same extent as (say) rcu_read_lock_trace().

You are quite right that it is possible for the risk of a backport to
exceed the risk of the original bug.

I defer to Joel (CCed) on how best to resolve this in -stable.

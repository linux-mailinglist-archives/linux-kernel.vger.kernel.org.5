Actually, there seems a functional change to add_new_gdb_meta_bg.
Assume 'group' is the new added group, 'first_group' is the first group
of meta_bg which contains 'group',
Original way to calculate gdbblock:
gdbblock = group_first_block('first_group') + bg_has_super(*'group'*)
New ay to calculate gdbblock
gdbblock = group_first_block('first_group') + bg_has_super(*'first_group'*)
If new added group is not the first group of meta_bg, add_new_gdb_meta_bg
get a wrong gdbblock.
Maybe it's more of a bugfix to as add_new_gdb_meta_bg treats group
as any group of meta_bg instead of first group of meta_bg. And it's
more of a cleanup as only first group is passed from caller.

Thanks for this information. But I'm little confused weather a cleanup
or a bugfix I should mention at the beginning. Any more advise is
appreciated!

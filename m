This case, hit following errors:

[  883.545800] r8169 0000:06:00.0:    [ 0] RxErr
[  883.545801] r8169 0000:06:00.0:    [ 8] Rollover
[  883.545802] r8169 0000:06:00.0:    [12] Timeout

#1 Timeout -- replay timer timeout, means endpoint didn't response with ACK DLLP or
NACK in time, that caused the re-send timer timeout, the sender will re-send the
packet.

#2 Rollover -- the counter of re-transmission reaches 0 (from 11b ->00b), means the
sender had tried 3 times. that would trigger link retraining to recover.

#1 & #2 happened together, but no uncorrected errors reported, means the link was
recovered, the issue mostly caused by improper TxEQ, receiver equalization, bad
signal integrity.

#3 RxErr -- bad DLLP, bad TLP, clock issue, signal integrity issue etc.

so, yup, basically, the signal integrity is not good enough.
Though the function could work, its performance will be impacted.

If we change it to "info" level, by default, users wouldn't see such errors, they
might hit more serious data corruption/malfunction in the future without WARN
precaution to them.

Thanks,
Ethan

This protects the memory image from external masters after the
measurement has been taken.

So any external influences in the time window between taking the
measurements and loading them into the PCRs are out of scope here, I
guess?

Maybe it would help (or if I missed it - apologies) to include a
threat model here. I suppose physical tampering is out of scope?

Thanks for the elaborate explananation. And yes, please document this
with the changes.

Then split this part further. Just because the architecture lumps two
completely unrelated concepts together doesn't mean we need to follow
the same organisation.

How is that possible? Are you saying that even things like timers are
firing as MSIs?

Again, we don't have to follow the split established by the
architecture. Instead, we should follow what is *functionally correct*
for the kernel. If we were to write Risc-V-OS, that'd be an acceptable
solution. But this is Linux, and the constraints are different.

My take on this discussion is that we should have:

- Direct-mode APLIC + IPI support as a an early irqchip driver

- MSI-bridge APLIC + MSI support as platform driver

Yes, these will likely share most of their code. But at least the
split will be manageable, and will avoid ugly hacks.

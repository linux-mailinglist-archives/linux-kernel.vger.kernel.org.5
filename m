FWIW, the kernel states that 0x0612 is ASM1062, and 0x0611 is ASM1061:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.7/drivers/ata/ahci.c#L603-L604

But that could of course be incorrect.


When you are dumping the LnkCap in the PCI ID DB change request,
are you dumping the LnkCap for the AHCI controller or the PCI bridge?

(Because you use # lspci -s 27:00.0 in the PCI ID DB change request,
but # lspci -s 28:00.0 further down in this email.)

(Perhaps the PCI bride only has one PCI lane, but the AHCI controller has two?)

That just claims that MSIs have to use a 32-bit PCI address.

See e.g.:
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 0b) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
  Subsystem: Lenovo Device 3978
  Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 58
  Memory at b0000000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4M]
  Memory at a0000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=256M]
  I/O ports at 4000 [size=64]
  Expansion ROM at <unassigned> [disabled]
  Capabilities: [90] MSI: Enable+ Count=1/1 Maskable- 64bit-
  Capabilities: [d0] Power Management version 2
  Capabilities: [a4] PCI Advanced Features
  Kernel driver in use: i915

It has 64-bit BARs, but does not support 64-bit MSIs.

If you are curious, hpriv->cap is the HBA capabilities reported by the
device, see:
https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/technical-specifications/serial-ata-ahci-spec-rev1-3-1.pdf

3.1.1 Offset 00h: CAP â€“ HBA Capabilities

Bit 31 - Supports 64-bit Addressing (S64A).

It seems a bit silly that the AHCI controller vendor accidentally set this
bit to 1.

Assuming that you just have ASM106x controllers in your system,
you could also replace it with a simple:

@@ -1799,6 +1823,10 @@ static int ahci_init_one(struct pci_dev *pdev, const struct pci_device_id *ent)
        if (ahci_broken_devslp(pdev))
                hpriv->flags |= AHCI_HFLAG_NO_DEVSLP;
 
+       /* must set flag prior to save config in order to take effect */
+       hpriv->flags |= AHCI_HFLAG_32BIT_ONLY;
+
 #ifdef CONFIG_ARM64
        if (pdev->vendor == PCI_VENDOR_ID_HUAWEI &&
            pdev->device == 0xa235 &&


Just for testing.

Were you running in a VM when testing this?
(Usually you need to pass through all PCI devices in the same iommu group.)

The errors from your previous email:
[IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0035 address=0x7fffff00000 flags=0x0000]
[Thu Jan  4 23:12:54 2024] ahci 0000:28:00.0: AMD-Vi: Event logged

could also suggest an iommu issue. Have you tried booting with iommu=off
and/or amd_iommu=off on the kernel command line?
(Or temporarily disable the iommu in BIOS.)

Looking forward to hear your findings :)

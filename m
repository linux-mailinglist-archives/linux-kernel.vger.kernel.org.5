Working again (embarrassingly I had the error source numbers reversed due
to a merge resolution that went wrong which took me a day to find). I'll flesh
out the injection but it will basically look like normal error injection
via qmp (json records) with a bonus parameter to stick them out as via
GHESv2 / CPER rather than AER internal error.  I've not figured out how
to wire HEST up for x86 emulation yet though so it's ARM virt only for now.
(HEST isn't created for x86 qemu machines whereas it is for arm virt with ras=on)
Obviously that emulation is wrong in all sorts of ways as I should be dealing
with firmware/OSPM negotiation and setting the messaging up etc but meh
- it works for exercising the code :)

On the plus side I get nice trace points using your series and Smita's one.
Quite a bit of data is 0s at the moment as I'm lazy and it's the end of the day
here - I'll fix that up later this week as I can see 'everything' in QEMU
and the register values etc are already handled via the native injection paths.

So let's be sure we mean the same thing here.  There is really no third
party CA.  Microsoft gives the distributions a signing key to allow
them to sign their version of shim.  Some distributions, like Red Hat,
also embed their signing certificates in shim, so shim can distinguish
between a RH key and another key added to MokList.  However, some
distributions, like SUSE, insist that all signing keys be approved by
the machine owner (so no embedded shim certs for non-enterprise) and
their shim can't distinguish between SUSE keys and machine owner
additions.  Given the variances in key handling, I think trying to
distinguish between official and developer keys is a huge addition of
complexity we don't need, so there has to be a workflow that functions
for both and that workflow would seem to be allowing non-existent or
empty sbat sections.  Official key holders  would *always* add sbat
sections, so there's really no problem that needs a solution to be
mandated here.

Forgot to mention that it is not really far fetched from comparing this
to MADV_FREE pages. Those are anonymous but we do not want to keep them
on anon LRU because we want to age them indepdendent on the swap
availability as they are just dropped during reclaim. Not too much
different from swapcache pages. There are more constrains on those but
fundamentally this is the same problem, no?

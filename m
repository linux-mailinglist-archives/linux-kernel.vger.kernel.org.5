I agree. The diff is really hard to look at. It will be easier to apply 
the patch & looks at the actual rstat.c file.

Right, I am thinking about a stack when I use the word "push". I will 
clarify that in the comment.

My mistake. Will fix it in the next version.

It is left over from before this patch. Will remove that.

Thanks for the comment. I will rework the comment to clarify that a bit 
more.

It will cost an additional 16 bytes of percpu memory if converted to 
list_heads. Like other lists, there will be sibling and children 
list_heads. There are also 2 pointers to update instead of one. Anyway, 
I don't have an objection to convert them to list_heads if agreed by Tejun.

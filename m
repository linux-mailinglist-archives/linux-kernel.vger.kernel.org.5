Ah ok, so the rtort_pipe_count being 9 is a sign RCU isn't making progress thus 
making it absent from the free list.

Makes sense.

Sure, makes sense. And this is not Lazy-RCU so 5 seconds should be plenty ;). I 
think I was subconsciously expecting an rcu_barrier() somewhere in the code 
before those checks, but that's not needed as you pointed that the stutter 
should be giving enough time for RCU to make progress.

So hmm, the count being 9 means that not enough RCU grace periods have passed 
for the rcu_torture object in question thus keeping it always allocated. The GP 
thread not getting CPU can do that indeed, or perhaps something else stalling 
RCU like a preempted reader, length preemption disabling on a CPU and so forth.. 
  I'll try to collect a trace when it happens.

thanks,

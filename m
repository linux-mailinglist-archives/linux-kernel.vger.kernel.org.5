I do not have the Synopsys HW manual, but RK3588 TRM has these:

obff_idle_int - controller received an 'IDLE' OBFF message.
obff_obff_int - controller received an 'OBFF' OBFF message.
obff_cpu_active_int - controller received an 'CPU Active' OBFF message.

Adding extra description to the interrupt-names list in the Rockchip
specific binding file does not work:

Additional properties are not allowed ('description' was unexpected)

But I suppose we are fine without them. People working on Rockchip
will easily find them in the TRM.

After looking at it again, my suggestion is to do the following
replacement in the Rockchip specific binding:

allOf:
  - $ref: /schemas/pci/snps,dw-pcie.yaml#

with

allOf:
  - $ref: /schemas/pci/pci-bus.yaml#
  - $ref: /schemas/pci/snps,dw-pcie-common.yaml#

Then the generic binding can stay as is. The Rockchip binding does
not use the "snps,dw-pcie" fallback compatible.

I played around a little bit and found this solution: Remove the
above allOf and instead add this to the allOf at the root level:

allOf:
  - if:
      not:
        required:
          - msi-map
    then:
      properties:
        interrupt-names:
         contains:
            const: msi

That might be sensible to do in the generic binding even when
Rockchip is no longer using it. The Rockchip binding has msi-map
in its required list, so it's fine without this.

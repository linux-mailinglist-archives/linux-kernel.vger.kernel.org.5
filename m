Our intention is not to break things, instead we wanted driver should
be sufficient to set a BD-Address, without putting a necessary
requirement on user space/Stack to configure BD-Address.
Other solutions ( like Android ) were approaching this
problem in this way. Now we also agree with your point
that we should not leave any scope for having a non-unique
BD-Address. Current bottleneck that we see with driver creating
and managing unique BD-Address on its own is how to ensure
persistence on reboot. If you are aware of any mechanism with
which we can ensure persistence in kernel across reboot please
let us know, otherwise we will write/reuse bluez-mgmt user
space utility to solve this problem.

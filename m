Yes, this is my current research objective.

Our current research goal is to find a possible dynamic balance between the
time consumption of passive memory reclamation and the application death
caused by active process killing.

The current strategy is to use proactive memory reclamation to intervene in
this process. As mentioned earlier, by actively reclaiming anonymous pages
that are deemed safe to reclaim, we can increase the currently available 
memory,
avoid lag when starting new applications, and prevent the death of resident
applications.

Through the previous discussions, it seems that we have reached a consensus
that although the active memory reclamation interface can achieve this goal,
it is not the best approach. Using MADV can both use existing methods to
achieve this goal and decide whether to reclaim based on the 
characteristics of
the anon vma, especially the anon_vma name set.

Therefore, I will also push for internal research on this approach.

OK, thanks. I have communicated with our internal team and found out that
this part of the memory usage will not be particularly large.

Yes, I get it.  This also means that if the reclaim algorithm changes, 
the current
implementation of tendencies will need to be modified accordingly, which 
requires
a certain cost to maintain.
If the current implementation of tendencies cannot prove its necessity, 
it should
be keep deep research.
This solution may be simpler for me to achieve our internal goals, but 
it may not be
the best solution.So, MADV_PAGEOUT is worth to research.

This conversation was very beneficial for me.
Thank you all very much.

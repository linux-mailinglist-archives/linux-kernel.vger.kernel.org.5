I see "scoped based put" follows a similar use in cleanup.h, but I
think "scope-based X" reads better.

I see several similar __free() uses with NULL initializations in gpio,
but I think this idiom would be slightly improved if the __free()
function were more closely associated with the actual pci_dev_get():

  struct pci_dev *pdev __free(pci_dev_put) = pci_get_device(...);

Not always possible, I know, but easier to analyze when it is.

Thanks for this!  I had skimmed cleanup.h previously, but it makes a
lot more sense after your description here.  

I think a little introduction along these lines would be even more
useful in cleanup.h since the concept is general and not PCI-specific.
E.g., the motivation (avoid resource leaks with "goto error" pattern),
a definition of "__free() based cleanup function" (IIUC, a function to
be run when a variable goes out of scope), maybe something about
ordering (it's important in the "goto error" pattern that the cleanups
are done in a specific order; how does that translate to __free()?)

But the commit log above is fine with me.  (It does contain tabs,
which get slightly mangled when "git log" indents it.)

This part is also fine but doesn't seem strictly necessary to me.  I
think the part about error reports being fed back needs a lot more
background to understand the connection, and probably only makes sense
in the context of that patch.

Thanks, Dan!

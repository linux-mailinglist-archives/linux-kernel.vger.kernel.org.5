Nothing to apologise for!

Although, this issue has no relation to the work I've been doing for anonymous large folios; It shows up for large _file_ folios. And it looks like the kernel was capable of doing large file folios for XFS before the collapse implementation went in, so I guess this behavior has always been the case:

So first, XFS supported it, then readahead actually started allocating large folios, then MADV_COLLAPSE came along.

Yes, I think this could be a useful capability. I'm currently investigating use of MADV_COLLAPSE as a work-around to get executable sections into large folios for file systems that don't natively support them (ext4 mainly). On arm64, having executable memory in 64K folios means we can make better use of the iTLB and improve performance.

No - its not a blocker for me. I just wanted to highlight the issue.

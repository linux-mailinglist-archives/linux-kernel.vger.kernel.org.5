Thanks. Alas, this machine doesn't have an IOMMU, which makes that 
difficult. I've definitely saved the link for the future, though.

In any case, the bisect is done:

     scsi: core: Detect support for command duration limits

     Introduce the function scsi_cdl_check() to detect if a device supports
     command duration limits (CDL). Support for the READ 16, WRITE 16, 
READ 32
     and WRITE 32 commands are checked using the function 
scsi_report_opcode()
     to probe the rwcdlp and cdlp bits as they indicate the mode page 
defining
     the command duration limits descriptors that apply to the command being
     tested.

     If any of these commands support CDL, the field cdl_supported of struct
     scsi_device is set to 1 to indicate that the device supports CDL.

     Support for CDL for a device is advertizes through sysfs using the new
     cdl_supported device attribute. This attribute value is 1 for a device
     supporting CDL and 0 otherwise.

This seems to match what was found on the Arch Linux forums, too:
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=288723&p=3

I haven't tried it yet, but according to that forum thread, removing the 
calls to scsi_cdl_check() seems to resolve the issue. This is all well 
beyond my SCSI knowledge, but maybe a quirk to disable these CDL checks 
for these older marvell controllers is required? Though it seems odd 
that the device would be rescanned and/or scsi_add_lun called multiple 
times a second -- is that normal?

In any case, this seems to be the cause.

Thanks!

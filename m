Does the following look fine?

While debugging the issue fixed by this patch, I had bisected and identified
that prior to the following commit:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e611f8cd8717c8fe7d4229997e6cd029a1465253
despite the race condition being present, there was no issue. While I am not
fully certain, I believe that the above observation indicates that prior to the
aforementioned commit, the race condition did exist, but there was a slightly
longer delay between the PHY providing the reference clock being powered off
within "ks_pcie_enable_phy()". That delay was sufficient for the dependent PHY
to lock its PLL based on the reference clock provided, following which, despite
the PHY providing the reference clock being powered off and the dependent PHY
staying powered on, there was no issue observed. Therefore, it appears to me
that holding reference to the PHY providing the reference clock isn't necessary
once the dependent PHY's PLL is locked.

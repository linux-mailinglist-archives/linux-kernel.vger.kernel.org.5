I borrowed the comment from current include/linux/cpumask.h, not a
particular commit.

I've no idea what that even tries to do; I don't speak bpf. And
typically bpf things don't work on my machines because I refuse to build
with BTF on since that blows up build times.

Yeah, I know, *shrug*. If you really care, I'd prefer to actually
implement that instead of fixing the comment.

Sure, can do.

I think I got that right, consider:

#elif MAX_NUMNODES <= 4*BITS_PER_LONG
  #define small_nodemask_bits nr_node_ids
  #define large_nodemask_bits ((unsigned int)MAX_NUMNODES)

IOW: small_nodemask_bits <= large_nodemask_bits (as per the naming)

So nodemask_weight() will look at less or all bits set/cleared.

The bug you referred to was using fill with nr_cpumask_bits, using
large_cpumask_bits would've been sufficient.

This move was needed to make it build -- compiler feels strongly you
should have declared a variable before using it etc.. No other
motivation for it. As such it sits in this patch.

> Why don't we make nr_cpu_ids to be a __ro_after_init just as well?

Sure, will add patch. Should've checked :/

My expectation is that adding new functionality should only require
changes in drivers that want to take advantage of it.  For example, if
we add runtime PM support in the controller driver, the result should
be functionally correct even if we don't update drivers for downstream
devices.

If that's not the way it works, I suggest that would be a problem in
the PM framework.

The host bridge might be a special case because we don't have a
separate "host bridge" driver; that code is kind of integrated with
the controller drivers.  So maybe it's OK to do controller + host
bridge runtime PM support at the same time, as long as any time we add
runtime PM to a controller, we sure it's also set up for the host
bridge.

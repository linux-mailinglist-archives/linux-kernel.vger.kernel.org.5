Yep, and I'd like to add that this could and have caused issues in
our production system, when there is a delay in memory limits
(low or max) correction. The userspace agent in charge of correcting
these only runs periodically, and within consecutive runs the system
could be in an over/underprotected state. An instantaneous charge
towards the memory controller would close this gap.

I think we need both a HugeTLB controller and memory controller
accounting.

Wondering why kexec-ed kernel is located under 0x1000000. The loading
code will search physical memory regions bottom up for an available one.
Usually, kexec kernel will be loaded above 16M.

I have posted a patchset to load kernel at top of system RAM for kexec_file
load just as kexec_load has been doing. Do you think it's helpful?

[PATCH 0/2] kexec_file: Load kernel at top of system RAM if required
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231114091658.228030-1-bhe@redhat.com/T/#u

Thanks

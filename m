I prefer to pass folio explicitly because it makes it clear that all pages in
the range must belong to the same folio.

I tried to do it that way, but the existing page_remove_rmap() also takes a
'compound' parameter; it can operate on compound, thp pages and uses the
alternative accounting scheme in this case.

I could add a compound parameter to folio_remove_rmap_range() but in that case
the range parameters don't make sense - when compound is true we are implicitly
operating on the whole folio due to the way the accounting is done. So I felt it
was clearer for folio_remove_rmap_range() to deal with small page accounting
only. page_remove_rmap() forwards to folio_remove_rmap_range() when
compound=false and page_remove_rmap() directly deals with the thp accounting
when compound=true.

File per protocol or better yet a directory per protocol vid and prot as files?
Files are cheap(ish) :) + expectation is probably a few protocols at
most per DOE and a few DOEs per device.

Bit similar to listing out end points for USB devices.

You may find it tricky to get anyone to move on that as I think we
had a fairly strong consensus behind a per protocol interface only.
One of the early DOE patch sets had a generic interface but we ripped
it out based on discussions at the time.

One avenue discussed (after SPDM lands in kernel) was to provide some
hooks for some parts of the exchange to be pushed to userspace, but
it was never totally clear to me which bits make sense.  If this
happens it will probably be the AMD SEV-SNP or similar usecase that
drives it with a tightly defined interface for this purpose (not
a generic DOE one).

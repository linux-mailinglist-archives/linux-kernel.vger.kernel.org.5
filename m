This device has a silicon bug that makes it report a timeout interrupt
but no data in the FIFO.

The datasheet states the following in the errata section 18.1.4:

  "If the host reads the receive FIFO at the same time as a
  time-out interrupt condition happens, the host might read 0xCC
  (time-out) in the Interrupt Indication Register (IIR), but bit 0
  of the Line Status Register (LSR) is not set (means there is no
  data in the receive FIFO)."

The errata doesn't explicitly mention that, but tests have shown
and the vendor has confirmed that the RXLVL register is equally
affected.

This bug has hit us on production units and when it does, sc16is7xx_irq()
would spin forever because sc16is7xx_port_irq() keeps seeing an
interrupt in the IIR register that is not cleared because the driver
does not call into sc16is7xx_handle_rx() unless the RXLVL register
reports at least one byte in the FIFO.

Fix this by always reading one byte when this condition is detected
in order to clear the interrupt. This approach was confirmed to be
correct by NXP through their support channels.

Meanwhile, NXP has confirmed this fix to be correct.

v4: NXP has confirmed the fix; update the commit log accordingly
v3: re-added the additional Co-Developed-by and stable@ tags
v2: reworded the commit log a bit for more context.

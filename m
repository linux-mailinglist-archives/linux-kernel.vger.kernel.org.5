I am not keen on this personally. I think these numbers are random to me and
why they help (or not help) is not clear to me at least.

I do believe that the only reason why we want to move before a task util
crosses the capacity of the CPU is tied down to the misfit load balance to be
able to move the task. Because until the task crosses the capacity, it is
getting its computational demand per our PELT representation. But since load
balance is not an immediate action (especially on our platforms where it is
4ms, something I hope we can change); we need to preemptively exclude the CPU
as a misfit when we know the task will get 'stuck' on this CPU and not get its
computational demand (as per our representation of course).

I think this removes all guess work and provides a very meaningful decision
making process that I think will scale transparently so we utilize our
resources the best we can.

We can probably optimize the code to avoid the call to approximate_util_avg()
if this is a problem.

Why do you think the ratio of cpu capacities gives more meaningful method to
judge misfit?


Thanks!

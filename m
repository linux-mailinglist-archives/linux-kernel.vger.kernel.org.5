I get what you are trying to do, but I should say that your justification so far
didn't do the justice.

Your point is that, if the PCIe BCR is asserted during boot (which can happen if
the bootloader didn't initialize PCIe for things like storage), then trying to
enable clocks will result in the "clk stuck" error from GCC. But in the case of
sc8280xp, bootloader would've already initialized PCIe during boot as it is uses
NVMe for things like firmware. But when you do a full power down during suspend
(CX power collapse), then while reinitializing the controller during resume, you
are hitting the "clk stuck" error because at that time, the BCR reset would be
asserted (POR value).

But I really suspect if that is the case... Because, the same init function is
being used by other SoCs (sm8150, sm8250, etc... even sdx55) and I'm pretty sure
that in those SoCs, the bootloader wouldn't have initialized PCIe during boot as
there is no use case.

So I cross checked it on SM8450, but I saw the BCR status being "0" during boot
(same as on sc8280xp). Then I checked the HPG and came to know that when the
PCIe GDSC is uncollapsed, some of the BCRs would be deasserted in the back.
Though it mentioned only PHY_BCR and not the PCIE_n_BCR. But I think the
behavior might be same for both. You can verify it by printing the state of all
BCRs during resume from suspend. This will give us some clue...

I do not have any strong argument here as there are too many things happening
that determines whether the controller is properly powered or not. So I'd say
that if you do not have any power numbers, it is best to leave it as it is.

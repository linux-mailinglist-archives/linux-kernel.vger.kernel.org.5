https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/sound/soc/sof/core.c#n328

it is called on the error path of sof_probe_continue(), which can be run
in a workque.

Yes, this makes the snd_sof_device_remove() redundant or at least the
definition of it is no longer a mirror of snd_sof_device_probe():

snd_sof_device_remove - might be called from wq (cleans up the
			snd_sof_device_probe step)

Any failure in sof_probe_continue() should execute the
snd_sof_device_remove(), snd_sof_remove() is only involved after the
snd_sof_probe() have returned with success.

I think this makes actually makes sense and it is well defined.
On module remove we need to take into account the case when we have
failed in wq similarly as we do currently (the resources have been freed
up already).

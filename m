Ok. Thanks for clarification. Then the semantic of the BARs in DW PCIe
RCs only has been changed since v5.10a. Dial-mode controllers had the
BARs available even in the older IP-cores. Good to know discovery
actually.

A simplest fix isn't always the best one. As you said yourself the
ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus() implies having it called for v3.65. Calling it
for the newer controllers was a mistake causing the bug. Thus having
the ks_pcie_ops utilized for both old and new controllers was also a
mistake. Therefor my suggestion to fix the problem by defining the two
pci_ops structure instances would be more correct at least from the
code readability point of view. It would make the
ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus() function body and name coherent.

Meanwhile your fix look more like a workaround. The
ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus() function will be still called for the AM6x
v4.90 controllers, which based on its semantic would be and will be
wrong in any case. So instead of noop-ing the function it would be
better to just drop it being called for the new controllers.

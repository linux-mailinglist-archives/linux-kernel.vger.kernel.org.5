No, I mean the *original* rcache patch submission, and its associated paper:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/cover.1461135861.git.mad@cs.technion.ac.il/

> then I think it's a 256-CPU system and the DMA controller has 16 HW queues. The 16 HW queues are relevant as the per-completion queue interrupt handler runs on a fixed CPU from the set of 16 CPUs in the HW queue interrupt handler affinity mask. And what this means is while any CPU may alloc an IOVA, only those 16 CPUs handling each HW queue interrupt will be free'ing IOVAs.

Remember that this threshold only represents a point at which we 
consider the cache to have grown "big enough" to start background 
reclaim - over the short term it is neither an upper nor a lower limit 
on the cache capacity itself. Indeed it will be larger than the working 
set of some workloads, but then it still wants to be enough of a buffer 
to be useful for others which do make big bursts of allocations only 
periodically.

Indeed, I would tend to assume that machines with hundreds of CPUs are 
less likely to be constrained on overall memory and/or IOVA space, so 
tuning for a more responsive cache should be more beneficial than any 
potential wastage is detrimental.

Cheers,
Robin.

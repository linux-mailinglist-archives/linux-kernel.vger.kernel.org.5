Initially I had a few retry iterations for the subtree flush, where we
fsleep for a bit and trylock again. I thought it was a little bit too
complicated and the fsleep duration would be a magic value.

The obstacle is high concurrency among flushers. A good example is
reclaim code, we can have a lot of concurrent reclaimers. When I tried
to go back to the original way of doing it, a stress test with high
reclaim concurrency (100s or 1000s) would be 2x-3x slower. I think
high concurrency among userspace reads would have a similar outcome,
but I hadn't really checked.

Basically this patch is trying to switch to root flushing when the
cost of contending on the lock is roughly the same as a root flush (or
waiting for one). It's doing that too eagerly now of course (if
contenders > 1), we can try to calibrate this better.

Keep in mind that in my testing, I noticed that synchronization using
a completion is more performant than serialization on a lock. I am
assuming because when we contend on the underlying lock, we serially
wake up and do the flush. Even if there is nothing to do (as you
mention below), we still do this work. On the contrary, in this
proposal we just wait for the root flush to finish and return
immediately, and all waiters return at once (that's a lie because of
scheduling internals).

Also, in the current code, in the two reader scenario, the first
reader will flush the entire tree anyway. The only difference is that
the second reader will wait for it to finish instead of just skipping,
which is the right thing to do from a correctness point of view. Right
now it's a coin flip on whether you get updated stats if someone else
is already flushing.

Having said that, I understand your concern, but I am not really sure
how to bring back subtree flushing for all cases without regressing
in-kernel flushers with high concurrency. I tried and it seemed to
harm performance (at least of synthetic benchmarks). I also tried to
break down the underlying rstat global lock, but that didn't turn out
to be simple either.

We need to do this for each parent in the hierarchy, not just the
memcg being updated, right? I guess that may be too expensive for the
update path.

I thought about doing it percpu and propagating to global "stat
deltas" when each cpu has enough updates, similar to what we do now
with the global delta. To do this efficiently we would want to move
that to the cgroup core code, since we already have parents iteration
in cgroup_rstat_updated() and we might want to reuse that. I also
thought that may be too complex.

Anyway, I am open to suggestions on how to improve this.

There have been a lot of problems coming from this global rstat lock:
hard lockups (when we used to flush atomically), unified flushing
being expensive, skipping flushing being inaccurate, etc.

I wonder if it's time to rethink this lock and break it down into
granular locks. Perhaps a per-cgroup lock, and develop a locking
scheme where you always lock a parent then a child, then flush the
child and unlock it and move to the next child, etc. This will allow
concurrent flushing of non-root cgroups. Even when flushing the root,
if we flush all its children first without locking the root, then only
lock the root when flushing the top-level children, then some level of
concurrency can be achieved.

Maybe this is too complicated, I never tried to implement it, but I
have been bouncing around this idea in my head for a while now.

We can also split the update tree per controller. As far as I can tell
there is no reason to flush cpu stats for example when someone wants
to read memory stats.

I don't have any idea on this front. The basic idea of making high level
distribution decisions in core code and letting individual drivers enforce
that in a way which fits them the best makes sense to me but I don't know
enough to have an opinion here.

For persistent resources, that's the general rule. Whoever instantiates a
resource gets to own it until the resource gets freed. There is an exception
with the pid controller and there are discussions around whether we want
some sort of migration behavior with memcg but yes by and large instantiator
being the owner is the general model cgroup follows.

So, my dumb understanding:

* Ownership of an fd can be established on the first ioctl call and doesn't
  need to be migrated afterwards. There are no persistent resources to
  migration on the first call.

* Memory then can be tracked in a similar way to memcg. Memory gets charged
  to the initial instantiator and doesn't need to be moved around
  afterwards. There may be some discrepancies around stolen memory but the
  magnitude of inaccuracy introduced that way is limited and bound and can
  be safely ignored.

Is that correct?

Thanks.

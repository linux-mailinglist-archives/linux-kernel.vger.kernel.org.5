But it did :(

It's not all that different of an environment, they use a stock kernel,
you can boot an android device just fine for many years without any
changes.

I would argue there are less changes in an android kernel than an
"enterprise" linux distro kernel these days by far :)

I think you rejected Android's changes, so what were they supposed to
do?  Or someone did, I can't remember when it was submitted, but i do
remember seeing the patches flow by on some list...

So because Android userspace is sending a flag value that is not in the
upstream table, this breakage is ok?  Or do you mean something else, I'm
getting confused.

I'm not sure it's necessary, tbh. It's not like we're calling
arm_smmu_sync_cd() all over the place -- it's used when we're actually
working with the CD.

Ah, sorry, I went and looked at the architecture and it says for
CMD_CFGI_STE:

  | This command invalidates all Context descriptors (including L1CD)
  | that were cached using the given StreamID.

so as long as we make the CD unreachable in the STE before the STE
invalidation (which I think we do by setting the Config field to bypass or
abort), then I agree that we don't need the subsequent CD invalidation.

Can you do it as its own patch then, please?

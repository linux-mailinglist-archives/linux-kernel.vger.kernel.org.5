I should have checked email before hit the send button for v10 :-).

It'd be more complicated and less readable to do all the stuff without the  
cgroup-tools, esp cgexec. I checked dependency, cgroup-tools only depends  
on libc so I hope this would not cause too much inconvenience.

I saw bash was also used in cgroup test scripts so at least that's  
consistent :-)
I can look into ash if that's required. Let me know.

Certainly can add more docs as you suggested.
Thanks
Haitao

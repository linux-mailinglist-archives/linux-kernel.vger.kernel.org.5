This all sounds like we are solidly in "system is overloaded" territory.

Soft-lockups are still not good in this case. But I am not sure what we
can do about it.

One silly idea is to prevent all vCPUs to do accept simultaneously and
reserve one (or several) to do housekeeping. The idea is that this vCPU
can be preempted to do job on other tasks.

It would only make a difference for PREEMPT_FULL case and if the
housekeeping CPU will hit the accept path from preemptable context. And it
is obviously not applicable if there's only single vCPU.

I am not sure why you differentiate these scenarios. Kernel just hits
place where it can be preempted and observes that it is overdue to
scheduling.

Yeah, at some point you will just saturate memory bandwidth.

This should not make one vCPU to setup on work on another. Page allocator
owns full 4MB. It is not shared with anyone.

Okay, yes, this is true.

Good catch. Care to send a patch?

This might improve situation with soft lockups a bit, but would hurt
accept bandwidth.

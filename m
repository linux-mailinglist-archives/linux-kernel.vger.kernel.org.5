One option to bail out the loop.

Yes, just after the wait descripor is submitted and before waiting in loop.

the rare but worst case.

Customer tried, but they didn't provide me the lastest trace.

Not fixed in v6.7rc4, with this patch, they said the unplug works.

I am trying to find a way to break it out in this qi_submit_sync().

  checking the device state in this loop, but seems not good in this

iommu low level code and need some interfaces to be modified.

That would cost me much more hours to make the rare case work,

to be perfect:

1.  check the pci device state in the loop

2.  modify the invalidation descriptor status in 
pciehp_ist()->intel_iommu_release_device() call.

The calltrace wouldn't tell us there is really timeout of 1min+50%

or not, event there is, meanlingless.

Too many paths to call this function, and revise it to non-sync, to much

things impacted.

Combinated with third party PCIe switch chips ?

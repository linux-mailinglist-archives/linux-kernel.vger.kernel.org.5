This new argument, however, is more convincing than the one you presented 
earlier. It is indeed true that even if we'd somehow end up into one of 
those root resources, its ->parent should be NULL (which differentiates 
this code from the other function which doesn't have similar ->parent 
check).

Also, the code has evolved to stop at the Root Port so it's another thing 
which should prevent even reaching that far.

I don't think so, 101 chars.

Nothing, but I also never wrote that wanting to be consistent is not objective.

I wrote that omitting the return statement is more "rusty" isn't an objective
argument in my opinion.

Maybe the misunderstanding is that consistent doesn't necessarily mean to do what
everyone else does. Consistency has a scope. For instance, we can also be consistent
with something that everyone else does differently, like linked lists throughout the
kernel.

This doesn't seem to be a "straight up" question. Hence, for the following I will
assume that you feel like I said those things about you.

First of all, I said that *we* (as a community) should not blindly follow formatters
and linters and should have objective reasons for language restrictions in general.
I never said anyone specific is doing that. Claiming that I did so, *would* be a straw
man.

Furthermore I was questioning two of the restrictions we already have and was asking
for an objective rationale for those, since the clipply documentation does not provide
an objective rationale in my opinion.

Generally speaking, I don't think there is anything wrong in saying that I think some
argument isn't objective (even if I'd be proven wrong). This is by far not the
same as saying someone has no objective reasons (in general). This would be a straw man
as well.

I already had the feeling from your answer in the other thread. But, unfortunately,
I don't understand why. If the above did not convince you otherwise, can you please
explain?

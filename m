If you look carefully you'll find that the 'hard IP' block stops
with a streaming interface that carries the data TLP.
All the logic to convert the TLP into Avalon memory cycles is verilog source.
So, at least in principle, it is modifiable.

With a bit of effort it is possible to trace the TLP into fpga memory.
(We had to modify the verilog to expose the TX TLP.)
Even allowing for development time it was probably cheaper than
buying a PCIe monitor!

I saw/checked you'd added a lock, didn't see it was the same one used
for config space accesses.

A lot of PCI devices solved this by adding a memory BAR that
mapped exactly the same registers.

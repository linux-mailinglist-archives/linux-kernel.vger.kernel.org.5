Hmmm.  08d0cc5f3426 ("PCI/ASPM: Remove pcie_aspm_pm_state_change()")
appeared in v6.0, released Oct 2, 2022, so it's been there a while.

But I think the best option is to revert it until this issue is
resolved.  Per the commit log, 08d0cc5f3426 solved two problems:

  1) ASPM config changes done via sysfs are lost if the device power
     state is changed, e.g., typically set to D3hot in .suspend() and
     D0 in .resume().

  2) If L1SS is restored during system resume, that restored state
     would be overwritten.

Problem 2) relates to a patch that is currently reverted (a7152be79b62
("Revert "PCI/ASPM: Save L1 PM Substates Capability for
suspend/resume""), so I don't think reverting 08d0cc5f3426 will make
this problem worse.

Reverting 08d0cc5f3426 will make 1) a problem again.  But my guess is
ASPM changes via sysfs are fairly unusual and the device probably
remains functional even though it may use more power because the ASPM
configuration was lost.

So unless somebody has a counter-argument, I plan to queue a revert of
08d0cc5f3426 ("PCI/ASPM: Remove pcie_aspm_pm_state_change()") for
v6.7.

Bjorn

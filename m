I claim that in the vast majority of cases this is the same as
deciding the state.

The case when it is not is when the target residency of the deepest
idle state is below the tick period length and the governor is about
to select that state.  According to the data I've seen so far this is
a tiny fraction of all the cases.

But this is my case 3 which you said you didn't agree with.  I don't
see why it needs to be fixed.

What about HZ=1000, though?

No, you don't, but is it really worth the fuss?

The state is high-latency anyway and tick_nohz_get_sleep_length()
needs to be called anyway in that case in order to determine if a
shallower state wouldn't be better.  At this point the statistics have
already told the governor otherwise and a misprediction would be a
double loss.

So yes, you can gain performance by avoiding to call
tick_nohz_get_sleep_length(), but then you can also lose it by
selecting a state that is too deep (and that can be determined exactly
with respect to timers).

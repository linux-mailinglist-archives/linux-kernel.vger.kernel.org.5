atomic_try_cmpxchg() updates curstate.state with the actual
group->migr_state when those values do not match. So it is reread by
atomic_try_cmpxchg() and still matches the description. (This at least
tells the function description of atomic_try_cmpxchg()).

But beside of this, why do I want to update curstate.state with
group->parent->migr_state when cmpxchg of this group wasn't successful
yet or was it a copy paste error?

When we are in lvl0, then @child is NULL as the child is a tmigr_cpu and
not a tmigr_group. This is the reason why I decided to store it inside
the tmigr_walk struct.

This is what I wanted to explain:

/*

 * into the parent group's timerqueue but can now be handled by the the
 * migrator of this group. Therefore the ignore flag for the group event

 * group. The lock is held while updating the ignore flag in idle
 * path. So this state change will not be lost.

I'll change it. Thanks.

No. Because the event is already queued into the hierarchy and the
migrator takes care. If hiererachy is completely idle, the CPU which
updated the event takes care. I'll add this to the comment above.

If the CPU is idle, check whether the recalculation of @tmc->wakeup
is required. @tmc->wakeup_recalc is set, when the last active CPU
went offline. The last active CPU delegated the handling of the timer
migration hierarchy to another (this) CPU by updating this flag and
sending a reschedule.

Better?

Yes and when wakeup_recalc is not set.

wakeup_recalc is required to indicate, that the CPU was chosen as the
new migrator CPU when the last active CPU in timer migration hierarchy
went offline.

When a CPU goes idle and it is the last active CPU in the timer
migration hierarchy, it has to make sure that it wakes up in time to
handle the first event of the hierarchy. On the normal idle path this is
not a problem as the value of the first event of the hierarchy is
returned. But when an IRQ occurs on this idle CPU, the timers are
revisited again. But then it is also required that the first event of
the timer migration hierarchy is still considered, as the CPU cannot
make sure another CPU will handle it. So the value is stored on idle
path to tmc->wakeup. Otherwise every idle CPU has to walk the hierarchy
again after an IRQ to make sure nothing is lost as the CPU doesn't know
what happend in the meantime. I'm aware, that it is possible that
several CPUs have the same wakeup value when there is no new first event
and if the hierarchy is idle and some CPUs become active and go idle
directly again. But if we want to cover this, we need a single point
with the first event and with the last migrator information and I'm
quite sure that it will not scale.

Hopefully this is now clear?

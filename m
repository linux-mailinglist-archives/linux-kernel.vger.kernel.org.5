Hey Baokun,

So IIUC, a BG with 32768 blocks free will have bb_fragments = 0 and in
mb_update_avg_fragment_size() we exit early if a BG has bb_fragments = 0
hence it won't show up in the order 13 list.

Ohh that's interesting, on paper I think it does seem like it should
improve the performance. I think if CR_GOAL_LEN_FAST can start including
blocks which are completely empty, and lift those restrictions then we
might see better performance. I'll try to play around a bit with this as
well.

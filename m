Thanks for doing this; I appreciate it!

Neat, I didn't know about this way of referencing doc in the source
file, although I see the markup isn't universally loved in source.
Either in cleanup.h or under Documentation/ is fine with me; grep will
find it either place.

I'm not a data structures person, but I don't remember seeing "FILO"
before.  IIUC, FILO == LIFO.  "FILO" appears about five times in the
tree; "LIFO" about 25.

Maybe:

  As drivers make up the majority of the kernel code base, here is an
  example of using these helpers to clean up PCI drivers with
  DEFINE_FREE() and DEFINE_GUARD, e.g.,:

Or just s/lets/let's/, although to my ear "let's" is a suggestion and
doesn't sound quite right in documentation.

I think DEFINE_FREE() and DEFINE_GUARD() are separable concepts, so
possibly move DEFINE_GUARD to that discussion.

Not only dictated, but it's strictly first-declared, last-unwound;
i.e., unwind order is the reverse of the declaration order, right?

As-is, I don't see the problem with this ordering.  I also don't see
why num, ret, bridge, and parent are relevant.  I think maybe this
just needs to be fleshed out a little more with a second cleanup to
fully illustrate the problem.

I don't think "xmas-tree style" is relevant to the argument here.  The
point is ordering with respect to other cleanup helpers.  I think it
would be good to include another such helper directly in the example.

A declaration mid-function may be required in some cases, but it's not
required here.  I'm not sure if adding an example to include a case
where it is required would be useful or overkill.

Good motivation for a commit log, but maybe a bit TMI for long-lived
documentation.

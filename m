Looking at the rock5b SBC (rockchip rk3588), the PHY refclk can either
be taken from
-a PLL internally from the SoC.
or
-an external clock on the SBC.

There does not seem to be an option to get the refclk as an input from
the PCIe slot. (The refclk can only be output to the PCIe slot.)

So when running two rock5b SBC, you cannot use a common clock for the RC
and the EP side, you have to use a separate reference clock scheme,
either SRNS or SRIS.

Since I assume that you use two qcom platforms of the same model
(I remember that you wrote that you usually test with
qcom,sdx55-pcie-ep somewhere.)
Surely this board must be able to supply a reference clock?
(How else does it send this clock to the EP side?)

So... why can't you run in SRNS or SRIS mode, where the EP provides
it's own clock?


Kind regards,
Niklas

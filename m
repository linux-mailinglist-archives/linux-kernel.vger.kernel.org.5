Again, I'm just an interested bystander, so take my words with a grain
of salt. That said, my understanding is that there is an intention to
get the vfio-user client code into qemu in the foreseeable future. The
most recent version of the code that I'm aware of is here:
https://github.com/oracle/qemu/tree/vfio-user-p3.1

Advanced PCIe concepts like PASID, ATS/PRI, SR-IOV etc. may lack equivalent=

 piece you need to bring is a VFIO-user server that handles these messages.=
 Its task is basically translating between VFIO-user and TLP and then injec=

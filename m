Ah, I see. That indeed is a bit confusing. And I think all users of 
coresight_enable_path() enables the source right after. So, I don't
see any point in having it separate. That said, this fix makes sense
and apologies for the confusion. We could may be cleanup the 
enable_path() to enable the source too, in a separate patch.

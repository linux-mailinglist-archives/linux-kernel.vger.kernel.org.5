As mentioned in previous mailï¼Œ before e66f17ff7177 ("mm/hugetlb: take
page table lock in follow_huge_pmd()") in v4.0, follow_page() will
return NULL on tail page for Huagetlb page, so move_pages() will return
-ENOENT errno, but after that commit, -EACCES is returned.

Meanwhile, the behavior of THP/HUGETLB is different, the whole THP will 
be migrated on a tail page, but HUGETLB will return -EACCES(after v4.0)
or -ENOENT(before v4.0) on tail page.

My question is,

Should we keep seem behavior between HUGETLB and THP, or only change the
errno from -EACCES to -ENOENT/-EBUSY.

I would like to drop PageHead() check for Hugetlb to keep seem behavior,
which will keep seem error code if isolate fail or success on head/tail
page.

Thanks.

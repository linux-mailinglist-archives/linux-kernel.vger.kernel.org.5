Interestingly I haven't got your message in the thread via `b4`.
Anyways, I think that was has been discussed at some point and
DT appears just to be handy blob format to be supplied along with
the device as "description of its configuration". Whatever format
is chosen it should be available for ACPI/DT/etc platforms and
be uniform. ACPI also supports overlays (as a debug feature, though)
but would it make sense to have AML (compiled ASL) for ACPI and DTB
for DT platforms and etc for etc platforms with duplicative data
inside with all limitations of the each of those formats and their
respective parsers/interpreters?

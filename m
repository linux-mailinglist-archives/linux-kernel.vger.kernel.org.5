The rational for a convention can't be that it is a convention. Instead
it should be a convention for an objective reason.

I'm not saying that we should enforce it otherwise, I just think that we
should have objective reasons for restrictions.

No, I didn't say, nor did I mean, that we should align with C in general,
nor should it be enforced.

However, I also don't see why we should disallow it as long as there is
no objective reason to do so.

That's actually what the language did already with early-return vs return at
the end of the function.

I admit that consistent inconsistency is also kinda consistent though. :-)

The language has various characteristics, maybe that's why it allows both?

See above.

Then it shouldn't be a warning either IMHO.

That's great, although I really don't understand why you think this one is, but
the other one isn't. What's the difference?

Thanks for the invitation, I'm happy to join!

I agree, but I also think it should be the other way around. We should have good
examples and an objective rationale for things we restrict.

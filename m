It is your misfortune to face this kind of machine trouble.

In the report[1], Matthias Schrumpf and Mark Broadworth noted to use AMD
Ryzen 7 5800X on B550/X570 chipsets, and insert VT6307 in their PCIe bus.
I guess that the device attends PCI bridge (ASM1083) since VT6307 has PCI
interface only.

We can see MCE error in another report[2]. Unfortunately, the reporter,
Ian Donnelly, have less suspiction about machine architecture, and never
provides hardware information. But I believe that it comes from AMD Ryzen
machine. I transcribe the error here:

```

[    0.861676] microcode: Microcode Update Driver: v2.2.
```

Additionally, as I note in the PR[3], I observed cache-coherence failure
over memory dedicated for DMA transmission. The mapping is created by
`dmam_alloc_coherent()` and no need to have extra care such as streaming
API. However, the combination of ASM1083 and VT6307 provides me bogus
values from the memory in AMD Ryzen machine, and I can see no issue in
Intel machines.

Essentially, the host system reboots when firewire-ohci module in guest
system probes the PCI device for 1394 OHCI hardware provided by PCI
pass-though[4].

I ordered equipments for the workflow, and waiting for shipping, since
my motherboard has no interface for serial output.

(However, I predict that we can no helpful output via the interface.)

For consumer use, the machine has no such function, I think. For
your information, this is the machine information I used:

* Ryzen 5 2400G
* Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd. AX370-Gaming 5/AX370-Gaming 5
    * BIOS F51h 02/09/2023

Nowadays FireWire software stack is optional in the most of
distributions. I can encounter the same issue at deferred probing enough
after booting up, even if the load of system is very low.

I've already tested with the driver compiled without these codes, but the
system reboots again.

I already suspect platform IOMMU and kernel implementation, however it
is helpless to disable AMD SVM and IOMMU in BIOS settings. Of course, it
is helpless as well to provide any options to iommu in kernel command line.

If I had any opportunity to access to AMD machines for enterprise-grade
usage somehow, I would have done it. However, I am a private-time
contributor and what I can access to is the ones for consumer use
without any hardware support for RAS reporting.

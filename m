Very likely. Matthew mentioned this to me not too long ago, i.e., that
on real-world platforms, ExitBootServices() typically fails the first
time because of this, and only succeeds the second time (note that the
first call disables async event delivery so the second call is
guaranteed to succeed unless the caller modifies the memory map
themselves)

Hello Jan，

Thanks for the detailed explanation! 😉

> resulting extent doesn't cover the full original range?

We adjust lstart when ac_o_ex.fe_len < ac_b_ex.fe_len and
ac_b_ex.fe_len < ac->ac_orig_goal_len, in which case the length of
the allocation is greater than the length of the original request,
and we would normally assume that this allocation would satisfy
the request for the block allocation without the need for an
additional allocation.

      /* we can't allocate as much as normalizer wants.
       * so, found space must get proper lstart
       * to cover original request */

And the comment in the code states that we need to "cover original
request", but this logic is not fulfilled in the code below, so yangerkun
is very puzzled and presents the above counterexample, so we think
it's a problem.

Totally agree, for the example above, if we end up with a total of 64
blocks, then the final extent distribution might look like this:

Before:  [0/9(9)], [9/64(55)]
Patched: [0/2(2)], [2/11(9)], [11/64(53)]

So the question is really whether we expect fewer allocations currently
or fewer fragments later.

goal_start          B    original_start   A              goal_end
   |-----------------|----------*----------|-----------------|
      best_ex_len                              best_ex_len

The current logic guarantees that the goal range will not be exceeded.
If original_start + best_ex_len > goal_end, then in case1 the ex_end
will be adjusted to align with the goal_end, and if the
goal_end < original_end, then another block allocation will be triggered,
which is fine. But in other cases, we can guarantee that the original
request will be covered by the adjusted best ex.

The problem is that in case2, when we aligned ex_fe_start with
goal_start, we exited the alignment as soon as we contained the
original_start, which may not have contained the original_end and
triggered an additional block allocation, but if we jumped to case3
we could cover the entire original request.

In general, this patch will not cause the goal range to be exceeded.

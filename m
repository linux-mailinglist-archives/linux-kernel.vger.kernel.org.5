HI Krzysztof,

  Thanks for the review.
  To answer the question,

"why ?" : The interrupts have been mis-interpreted on many platforms or 
many interrupts are missing.

Now, if I am adding the missing interrupts, I need to segregate targets 
also into respective buckets in the same patch and that is what making 
this patch a little complicated. Is it possible / acceptable to split 
this into two patches if this is the case. Can you help with suggestions 
from your end ? Or may be I am understanding your question wrong ? ðŸ˜…

Regards,
Krishna,

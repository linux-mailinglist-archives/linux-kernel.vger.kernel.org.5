Right, this is pretty much exactly what the x86-android-tablets
code does. Except that it does it for a bunch of boards in a single
.ko / driver. There is a lot of commonality between these boards,
so this allows sharing most of the code.

The driver uses DMI matching, with the match's driver_data pointing
to a description of which devices to instantiate and then the shared
code takes care of instantiating those.

About 90% of the data / code is __init or __initdata so both
the code to instantiate the devices as well as the per board
data is free-ed after module_init() has run.

Ok, I have just finished implementing this using the ii. method.

I'll post a patch-series for this for review right after this email.

After that series x86-android-tablets should no longer be a problem
wrt using any private gpiolib APIs.

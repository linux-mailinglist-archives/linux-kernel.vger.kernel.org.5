Thanks for explaining it.

There is an error code to return from max_write. I can add that too to the  
callback definition and fail it when it can't be enforced for any reason.
Would like some community feedback if this is acceptable though.

I think to solve it ultimately, we need be able to adjust 'capacity' of  
VMs not to just kill them, which is basically the same as dynamic  
allocation support for VMs (being able to increase/decrease epc size when  
it is running). For now, we only have static allocation so max can't be  
enforced once it is launched.

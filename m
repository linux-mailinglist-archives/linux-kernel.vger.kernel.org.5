About interrupt, I am a bit stuck on my side.
My dtso (applied at PCI device level) contains the following:
	fragment@0 {
		target-path="";
		__overlay__ {
			pci-ep-bus@0 {
				compatible = "simple-bus";
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <1>;

				/*
				 * map @0xe2000000 (32MB) to BAR0 (CPU)
				 * map @0xe0000000 (16MB) to BAR1 (AMBA)
				 */
				ranges = <0xe2000000 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x2000000
				          0xe0000000 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x1000000>;

				itc: itc {
					compatible = "microchip,lan966x-itc";
					#interrupt-cells = <1>;
					interrupt-controller;
					reg = <0xe00c0120 0x190>;
				};
				
				...
			 };
		};
	};

I have a 'simple-bus' with a 'ranges' property to translate the BAR addresses
then several devices. Among them a interrupt controller (itc). Its parent
interrupt is the one used by the PCI device (INTA).
I cannot describe this parent interrupt in the dtso because to that I need the
parent interrupt phandle which will be know only at runtime.
Of course, I can modified the overlay applied to tweak the 'interrupt' and
'interrupt-parent' in the itc node from my PCI device driver at runtime but I
would like to avoid this kind of tweak in the PCI device driver.
This kind of tweak is overlay dependent and needs to be done by each PCI
device driver that need to work with interrupts.

For BAR addresses translation, we use the 'ranges' property at the PCI device
node to translate 0 0 0 to BAR0, 1 0 0 to BAR1, ...
What do you think about a new 'irq-ranges' property to translate the irq number
and get the irq parent controller base.

irq-ranges = <child_irq_spec parent_irq_spec length>;

The idea would be to translate the child irq specifier (irq number +
possible flags) parent DT node.
if 'irq-ranges' present in parent translate irq spec then:
1) 'interrupt' present in parent.
   In that case, if the translation match, we use the translated irq spec
   and resolve the parent interrupt controller using existing ways from this
   node. If it does not match: error.
2) 'interrupt-map' present in parent.
   We use existing ways from this node with the translated irq spec to get the
   parent interrupt controller.
3) 'interrupt-controller' present in parent.
   We use this node as parent interrupt controller and the translated irq spec
4) no specific property present, update parent taking the parent's parent and
   go again.

With this the overlay becomes:
	pci-ep-bus@0 {
		compatible = "simple-bus";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;

		/*
		 * map @0xe2000000 (32MB) to BAR0 (CPU)
		 * map @0xe0000000 (16MB) to BAR1 (AMBA)
		 */
		ranges = <0xe2000000 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x2000000
		          0xe0000000 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x1000000>;

		/* Translate PCI IRQ*/
		irq-ranges = <1 1 1>;

		itc: itc {
			compatible = "microchip,lan966x-itc";
			#interrupt-cells = <1>;
			interrupts = <1>;
			interrupt-controller;
			reg = <0xe00c0120 0x190>;
		};
		
		...
	 };

And the PCI device node built at runtime:
	dev@0,0 {
		#address-cells = <0x03>;
		interrupts = <0x01>;  <-- use parent interrupt-map
		#size-cells = <0x02>;
		compatible = "pci1055,9660\0pciclass,020000\0pciclass,0200";
		ranges = ...;
		irq-ranges = <1 0x01 1>
		reg = <0x10000 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00>;
	};
or
	dev@0,0 {
		#address-cells = <0x03>;
		interrupts = <NN>;
		interrupts-parent = <phandle'
		#size-cells = <0x02>;
		compatible = "pci1055,9660\0pciclass,020000\0pciclass,0200";
		ranges = ...;
		irq-ranges = <1 NN 1>
		reg = <0x10000 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00>;
	};

In the second case, interrup-map in bridges nodes is still needed to build the
'interrupts' / 'interrupts-parent' in devices nodes.
and irq-ranges (if it makes sense on your side) allow to get and interrupt from
the overlay without the need to know the irq parent phandle.

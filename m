Hello Hans,

Thank you for your support so far. I really appreciate this.

I have always wanted to contribute to the kernel, so, this is fun for me! :)


The 2 evtest logs show that each brightness up/down keypress
gets reported twice, once by the "ACPI video bus" device and
once bythe "Asus WMI hotkeys" device.

I do not think these are multiple events. There are different. One has 
the value of 0, the other has value of 1.
I am not sure what they mean. I initially thought it could be keydown 
and keyup events, but it is not, because
on pressing the keydown, they are still both reported. I also think the 
desktops handle this, maybe by filtering out
0 values. I use KDE Plasma, and I still have 5% step despite evtest 
reporting these 2 events.


I have applied the last 2 patches.

1. Show no output for capslock / printscreen

Correct. These keys are no longer captured by Asus WMI hotkeys

2. Show KEY_SELECTIVE_SCREENSHOT events for the
    "Screen Capture" hotkey.

I am not sure I am getting KEY_SELECTIVE_SCREENSHOT event for the 
"Screen Capture" hotkey. This is what I get:
Event: time 1697757579.588239, type 4 (EV_MSC), code 4 (MSC_SCAN), value 2a
Event: time 1697757579.588239, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 634 (?), value 1
Event: time 1697757579.588239, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1697757579.588244, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 634 (?), value 0
Event: time 1697757579.588244, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------

And this is what I get for "Screen Capture" hotkey, from the debug you 
placed
[ 1096.691389] asus_wmi: raw event code 0x2a
[ 1096.691446] asus_wmi: raw event code 0xffffffffffffffff
[ 1097.982976] asus_wmi: raw event code 0x2a
[ 1097.983032] asus_wmi: raw event code 0xffffffffffffffff


3. Show no output for brightness up/down,
    yet brightness up/down should still work since
    these are also reported by the "ACPI video bus"

Yes, correct. No output from Asus WMI hotkeys, but there an output from 
Video bus


Thanks

James

No worries, I didn't suspect a PCI issue here; I just wasn't clear on
what ACPI=>PCI mapping was involved.  It sounds like there *is* no
such mapping in this picture (you find the ACPI object for a PCIe/CXL
host bridge, evaluate _UID from that object, and get a bogus value).

So the commit log text:

  However, on some production systems from some vendors, a buggy BIOS
  exists that improperly populates the ACPI => PCI mappings.

apparently refers to improper implementation of the _UID, which
doesn't return anything PCI related.

It also says:

  This leads to the cxl_acpi driver to fail probe when it cannot find
  the root port's _UID, in order to look up the device's CXL
  attributes in the CEDT.

I *think* strictly speaking this should refer to the *host bridge's*
_UID, not the Root Port's, e.g., something like this:

  However, on some production systems from some vendors, a buggy BIOS
  provides a CXL host bridge _UID that doesn't match anything in the
  CEDT.

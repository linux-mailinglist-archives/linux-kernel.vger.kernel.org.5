Not perfect but I guess the enum definition could use 
PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_NLW_X* to ensure at least the PCIe ones match.

Yes, thanks. I added a patch to address those duplicated defines and 
I also noticed it had a duplicated copy for PCI_EXP_LNKSTA which I also 
converted.

I'll send v2 which has most of your suggestions taken into account once 
the build bot has done its thing.

No, there are actually 3 if one looks carefully, and many more if the 
ones named according to the driver are also counted all following this 
same "not nice" pattern. ;-)

That's 3 different drivers though which just happen to be similarly named 
so it's not entirely fair as it would be same as saying drivers x, y, and 
z have something with the same name. It's pretty obviously those come from 
copy paste though which usually means some common code might have been 
handy.

Yeah, I've plenty of 'interesting' stuff I've noticed while looking around 
on my todo list. I even thought I had that general PCI_EXP_* FIELD_GET() 
cleanup on it as I recall eyeing what it would take to find all of them 
but it seems I never added that there (now it is).

But then I was taking a look at these Link Width ones and there was just 
so much low-hanging fruit (some of which are like you put it, an 
excellent example of good cleanup) so I went to do that right away 
without considering all the other fields.

Thanks a lot for taking a look.

Well, currently, yes; that's the in_protocol check in
shim.c:verify_sbat_section().  However, I was assuming based on this
thread, that that was being tightened up (either because people are
moving away from grub or because the shim verifier protocol would
enforce it) as you imply below.

That might work, but it's not currently in the shim code base.  It also
wouldn't work for SUSE I suspect: they actually put all of their distro
keys into MokList (so the machine owner has to approve any SUSE key
update), so how can shim tell the difference between my key and their
key?

Well, I agree with this, since it was my original point.  However, a
key observation still seems to be that none of this exception proposal
is actually coded anywhere, so if shim does tighten up sbat
verification, everyone currently gets caught by it (and if it doesn't
then the kernel doesn't need an sbat section).

I really think if this exception proposal is what everyone is planning,
then you can simply leave the upstream kernel alone, since it won't
require sbat information unless incorporated into a distro.

So the direction forward seems to be to get this exception proposal
coded up and agreed and then we can decide based on that whether the
upstream kernel needs to care.

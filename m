Yes, I tried some stuffs in that way...

... and I went up to that point.
Further more with that way, we need to update the addr value retrieved
from the device requesting the interrupt.
  https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/of/irq.c#L343
Indeed, with the current 'interrupt-map' at bridges level, a addr value
update is needed at the PCI device level if the interrupt is requested
from some PCI device children.
This is were my (not so good) interrupt-ranges property could play a
role.

May I help you on some points?

Got a system with a real hardware (Lan966x) and a setup using an ARM platform (full
DT) and an other one using an x86 platform (ACPI).
Also, I have some piece of code to create the PCI host bridge node.
Of course, this need to be first working on a full DT system but I can do some test
to be sure that can be still ok on a ACPI system.

Right.
With the PCI device seen as an interrupt controller, there is no more need of
this interrup-ranges property.

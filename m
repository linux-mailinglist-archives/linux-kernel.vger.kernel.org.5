No strong opinion here, either.  Just one trivial comment/question below on
the new patch (if that will be preferred)..

.. here will the ptl always be valid?

That comes from the previous round of pte_offset_map_lock(), and I assume
after this whole "thp collapse without write lock" work landed, it has the
same lifecycle with the *pte pointer, so can be invalid right after the rcu
read lock released; mmap read lock isn't strong enough to protect the ptl,
not anymore.

Maybe it's all fine because the thp collapse path is the solo path(s) that
will release the pte pgtable page without write mmap lock (so as to release
the ptl too when doing so), and we at least still hold the page lock, so
the worst case is the other concurrent "thp collapse" will still serialize
with this one on the huge page lock. But that doesn't look as solid as
fetching again the ptl from another pte_offset_map_nolock().  So still just
raise this question up.  It's possible I just missed something.

There is another problem, when delayed copy is used. The content comes
from one source, metadata from another.

I initially created test-file-lower on the lower directory
(overlayfs/data), before mounting overlayfs. After mount on
overlayfs/mnt:

# getfattr -m - -e hex -d overlayfs/mnt/test-file-lower 
# file: overlayfs/mnt/test-file-lower
security.evm=0x02c86ec91a4c0cf024537fd24347b780b90973402e
security.ima=0x0404f2ca1bb6c7e907d06dafe4687e579fce76b37e4e93b7605022da52e6ccc26fd2
security.selinux=0x73797374656d5f753a6f626a6563745f723a756e6c6162656c65645f743a733000

# chcon -t unconfined_t overlayfs/mnt/test-file-lower

After this, IMA creates an empty file in the upper directory
(overlayfs/root/data), and writes security.ima at file close.
Unfortunately, this is what is presented from overlayfs, which is not
in sync with the content.

# getfattr -m - -e hex -d overlayfs/mnt/test-file-lower 
# file: overlayfs/mnt/test-file-lower
security.evm=0x021d71e7df78c36745e3b651ce29cb9f47dc301248
security.ima=0x04048855508aade16ec573d21e6a485dfd0a7624085c1a14b5ecdd6485de0c6839a4
security.selinux=0x73797374656d5f753a6f626a6563745f723a756e636f6e66696e65645f743a733000

# sha256sum overlayfs/mnt/test-file-lower
f2ca1bb6c7e907d06dafe4687e579fce76b37e4e93b7605022da52e6ccc26fd2  overlayfs/mnt/test-file-lower

# sha256sum overlayfs/root/data/test-file-lower 
8855508aade16ec573d21e6a485dfd0a7624085c1a14b5ecdd6485de0c6839a4  overlayfs/root/data/test-file-lower (upperdir)

We would need to use the lower security.ima until the copy is made, but
at the same time we need to keep the upper valid (with all xattrs) so
that IMA can update the next time overlayfs requests that.

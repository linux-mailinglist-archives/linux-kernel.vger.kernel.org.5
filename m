Are you actually using firmware-controlled AER or is it a theoretical
question?

PCI Firmware Spec r3.3 sec 4.6.12 talks about a _DSM to disable DPC
on surprise-hotplug-capable ports.  Maybe that would be an option?

BTW what happens if the system resumes from sleep and a device in
a hotplug-capable port doesn't have a bus number configured yet
(because it's been powered off and is now in D0uninitialized state)?
Could the ACS Violations then occur as well?  Do we have to mask
ACS Violations *generally* on Root Ports and Downstream Ports when
going to system sleep and unmask them after setting a bus number
in the attached device on resume?  And I suppose that would not
only be necessary for hotplug ports?

Thanks,

Lukas

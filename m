That really sounds like the setup is missing cgroup layers tracking
persistent resources. Most of the problems you describe can be solved by
adding cgroup layers at the right spots which would usually align with the
logical structure of the system, right?

Yeah, it does sound better when viewed that way. I'm still not sure what
extra problems it solves tho. We experienced similar problems but AFAIK all
of them came down to needing the appropriate hierarchical structure to
capture how resources are being used on systems.

Thanks.

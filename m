I agree, that's not what I'm saying here.

I'm talking about a patch where you are changing the existing
user/kernel api by filtering out values that you previously accepted.
And it was done in a patch saying "this might break userspace", and
guess what, it did!

So why not revert it as obviously you all anticipated that this might
happen?

The "internal" patch from Android was just using the upper values of the
fuse api because they didn't want to conflict with the upstream values
before their code was accepted (and it was submitted already, but not
accepted.)

So how do you want developers to work on changes before they are
accepted with this user/kernel numbering scheme that you have?  You just
broke anyone who was using a not-accepted-in-the-tree value, right?

thanks,

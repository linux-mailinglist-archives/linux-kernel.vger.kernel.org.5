That is correct, that patch you mentioned is a regression to some of the 
extension correction logic.

The regression caused by the patch you mentioned is resolved by 
("net/sched: taprio: update impacted fields during cycle time adjustment").
Here's a snippet:
		if (cycle_corr_active(oper->cycle_time_correction) &&
		    (next->gate_mask & BIT(tc)))
			next->gate_close_time[tc] = end_time;

The `end_time` here is already corrected. The corrected `gate_close_time` 
is then used by taprio_dequeue_from_txq() -> taprio_entry_allows_tx(), 
which now takes dynamic scheduling into account.


However, the extension logic had other issues even before that patch. 
Example, in should_change_schedules(), it didn't consider if the next entry 
is the last one in the oper cycle before extending the schedule.
Although this comes as no surprise as there was already a FIXME tag in 
should_change_schedules().


This patch primarily addresses the should_change_schedules() logic using 
the new get_cycle_time_correction().

Alright, my use of the term "API" was a bit casual without much 
consideration â€“ my mistake.

I intentionally made should_change_schedule() slightly different from 
cycle_corr_active() and, unfortunately, stateful by resetting 
oper->cycle_time_correction. My aim was to have two functions with clear 
names reflecting their intentions based on usage.

For instance, this:
	if (should_change_schedule(oper)) {
    		oper->cycle_end_time = new_base_time;
    		end_time = new_base_time;

is less intuitive than this:
	if (cycle_corr_active(oper->cycle_time_correction)) {
    		oper->cycle_end_time = new_base_time;
    		end_time = new_base_time;

And this:
	if (!oper || should_change_sched(oper))
	   	switch_schedules(q, &admin, &oper);

reads clearer than:
	if (!oper || cycle_corr_active(oper->cycle_time_correction))
		switch_schedules(q, &admin, &oper);


Normally I prefer clear function names that don't need comments for 
explanation. But I probably overthink it, seems to have more cons than 
pros. Will replace with a single sched_change_pending() as suggested, thanks.

My bad on the oper null check.

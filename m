Here's my test script, just put all three shell scripts in the same 
directory,
change the disk and dir, then run `sh test-io.sh`, and the inconsistency is
reproduced under ext4 in just one round, and after switching the
filesystem to xfs, the problem is no longer reproduced. So it looks like
xfs guarantees consistency in this scenario. But you're right, a test case
can't trigger a problem doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist.
Thank you very much for the correction.

Ah, I'm guessing it died in:
ver = dw_pcie_readl_dbi(pci, PCIE_VERSION_NUMBER);

If so, that's the same hang that this patch is aiming to solve. I'm 
starting to wonder if having muxed pins != 1 for a given signal upsets 
the RC(s). Is your board (in an earlier boot stage: 
reset/maskrom/bootloader) muxing a different perstn pin option to that 
controller (and Linux doesn't know to clear it away)? Then when you add 
the perstn pinctrl the total number of perstns muxed to the controller 
comes to 2, and without a reset-gpios = <...>; to take it away again, 
that number stays at 2 to cause the hang upon the DBI read?

If so, that'd mean the change resolves the hang for me, because it 
brings the total up to 1 (from 0), but also causes the hang for you, 
because it brings the total up to 2 (away from 1).

Mm, maybe. Though that might be more appropriate if a board comes along 
that doesn't connect all of those signals to the same group of pins. I 
worry that attempting to solve this hang by doing that will instead just 
mask the real problem.

Then it's interesting that this board requires them in order to avoid a 
hang on boot. I'll see if there's anything else that I can find out.

Happy Friday,
Sam

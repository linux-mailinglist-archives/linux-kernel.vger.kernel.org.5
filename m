It nevertheless from the point of kernel development *afaics* is a
kernel regression, as it doesn't matter much if the root of the problem
is a hw problem; what matters primarily is that the problem apparently
did not happen before the commit mentioned in the subject.

Which bears the question: Can the culprit (and others commits that might
be depending on it) still be reverted without causing regression itself?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

If I did something stupid, please tell me, as explained on that page.

Hi Parthiban,

I have ipv6 disabled and use static ipv4 addresses. That could be the reaso=
n why on
my side no packet is sent.

Perfect, thats the same I added and also works on my side.

Sorry there is a missunderstanding between us. The receive buffer overflow =
is not
causing any=C2=A0harm except filling the log. In my setup I get in one day =
about 35000
entries. I am not sure=C2=A0if its appropriate to log these errors.

The SPI Frequency is at 14.8 MHz. If I just have 2 boards connected, I am n=
ot able
to reproduce this. Only with 3 boards when 2 boards sends multiple big ethe=
rnet
frames (1512 byte per Frame) to one, I get these log entries.=C2=A0
The latency seems to be quite low, from IRQ to start reading first frame it=
 takes
always less than 500us. Also the boards are just running the udp test.

I use a internal tool which does some stress tests using udp. Unfortunately=
,
I am not allowed to publish it, but a colleague works on a rust implementat=
ion,
which we can publish, but its not fully ready yet.
On one board the tool is running in server mode. It just echoes back the re=
ceived
data. On the 2 other boards the tool is running in client mode. It sends va=
rious
sized udp-packets in different bursts and then checks if it receives the sa=
me
data in the same order.


The crashes only happens when ZARFE is not set (with Rev B0). When the cras=
h
happens, I see on the logic analyzer that there are more bytes than mtu + h=
eaders
between the frame where start_valid is set and the frame where end_valid is=
 set.
Then this happens:

If interested I can try to get a recording with the logic analyzer and send=
 it to you.

By the way in the other answer you attached a screenshot of the logic analy=
zer and you
have a very nice HLA for oa_tc6. Are they open-source or are there any plan=
s to publish them?

Unfortunately I just have LAN8651 Rev. B0 Chips. Are you sure that the Rev =
B1 has the
issue fixed? The errata here says that B1 is affected too:

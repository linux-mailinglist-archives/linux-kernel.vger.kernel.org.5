Please change away!  We are allowed to change anything we want here, as
long as you fix up all in-tree users of the functions.  Nothing is ever
"frozen" in the in-kernel apis.

We can wait to actually create the directory when the first visible file
is present.  That is what my patch was attempting to do (well, it
removed it if non-visible) but as you point out, it's obviously broken :)

So switch it around, only create the directory when it is explicitly
needed.

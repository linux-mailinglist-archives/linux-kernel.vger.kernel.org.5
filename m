It doesn't have to say anything about the idle duration as long as it
says something about the governor's "accuracy".

If it is observed experimentally that the governor is generally likely
to mispredict a deeper state if CPu utilization is about a certain
threshold, then it makes sense to use this information to counter
that.  That's how it is used today.

And yes, you are right about the most immediate idle duration, but
overall the rule that if the CPU utilization is high, then selecting
deep idle states is not a good idea in general does seem to hold.

No it is not IMO, because idle is all about the combined outcome of
multiple cycles.

As stated in my last reply, the only case in which it makes a
difference is when the deepest idle state's target residency is below
the tick and I'm not really sure if that difference is demonstrably
significant.

So I would do the following to start with:

1. Rearrange the teo code so that it considers all of the bins every
time without calling tick_nohz_get_sleep_length().

2. The sched_cpu_util() check will still be applied to the resulting
candidate state as it is now.

3. If it finds that the candidate state is shallow enough (for
instance, it is a polling state or the first non-polling one), it will
return this state without calling tick_nohz_get_sleep_length() and
stopping the tick.

4. Otherwise it will call tick_nohz_get_sleep_length() to see what
about timers and refine the selection (towards the shallower states)
if need be.

5. If the candidate state is not the deepest one and its target
residency is below the tick, it will be returned and the tick will not
be stopped.

6. Otherwise, the candidate state will be returned and the tick will be stopped.

If this still doesn't get us where we want to be, the extra bin can be
added (as long as it makes a measurable difference).

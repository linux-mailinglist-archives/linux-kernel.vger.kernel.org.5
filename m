To me (and maybe the same for Wedson), it's actually Ok that we don't do
the change (i.e. the ArcBorrow -> &WithRef) at all. It's more a
code/concept simplification.

Fixing with an `UnsafeCell` seems more like a workaround to me, because
there is no interior mutable requirement here, so I just don't want to
patch something unnecessary here just to make things work.

Put it in another way, if `UnsafeCell` can fix this and no interior
mutability is needed, we probably can fix this with another way or there
is an API like `UnsafeCell` is missing here.

Sorry for being stubborn here ;-) But I really want to find a better
solution for the similar problems.

What's the shortcoming of ptr2int?

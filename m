I think the problem is that we don't run kernel-doc by default.  Instead,
it's only run for W=1 (and higher) builds.  That's why Carlos doesn't
see the problems he is introducing in his own builds.  Of course, if
AMD required building with W=1 then they'd see these problems earlier
in their own testing.  Apparently they don't.

Is it time to just run kernel-doc by default?  There aren't _that_
many kernel-doc warnings now.  Not compared to how they used to be.
And enabling them for everyone means that new ones won't sneak in.
I haven't timed how much extra time kernel-doc adds to a build.
Perhaps that's infeasible.

Coming to you from Bit-8.net now.

It really seems the relevant philosophy in computing space, is Izlam.

Its referred in art, and furthermore the concept of The Deity, SIN used 
in electronics schematics, is from The Kuran.
And the concept of Deiy, S i D (approximate latinization) used for many 
computer designs, is from The Kuran.

And an ongoing art, is to make concepts that work well for both, since 
they are the most relevant concepts.

I actually realized that TaSIN, also a concept of The Deity, from The 
Kuran, may be a concept, that works well for both. And can replace them, 
unifying electronic schematics and computer design.

It may already work well for "Linux" that may originally be a concept 
that worked well for SIN and S i D. MAny concepts there are like this.

And GNU as a concept seems to think so aswell. And it covers over the 
inaccurate "God", and rejects the regressed Bible.

Indeed, Izlam and the concepts from it, I talk about here, are much 
better suited.

Izlamic concepts is indeed what makes computing space intelligent.

And many berate the atheistic Bill Gates, and windows, and it was never 
much for enthusiasts.

TaSIN can be represented with an 8 symbol.

And I am on Bit-8.net now, having gone through some main themes with 
Izlam, and you can read about it there.

Mainly the moonsymbol is not realliy Izlamic. "Jihad, Hijab" that the 
sects monotonically focus on, is really a moonidol, and not Izlam.

If you are interested, please read more on: Bit-8.net

Peace,
Ywe CÃ¦rlyn.

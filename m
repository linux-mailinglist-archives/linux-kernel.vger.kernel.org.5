Yes thanks for the review. We will certainly add the parameter 
constification in the next version.

Sorry for the lack of clarity. The hook call happens right after the 
built-in signature verification in fsverity. This hook's main job is to 
allow LSM to store the verified signature so that it can be used for 
future LSM checks.

As Paul mentioned, with IPE, we can add kernel enforcement that only 
files with the fs-verity built-in signature enabled are allowed. 
Currently, IPE uses the above hook to save the signature in the file's 
security blob, and then it decides whether to permit or deny file 
operations based on the presence of the fs-verity built-in signature.

But our plans don't end there. In the future, we intend to add more 
features to address the security gaps mentioned in the documentation 
related to the fs-verity built-in signature. For instance, we will 
introduce a certificate policy rule to limit which signatures can be 
trusted, thus resolving issues related to the validity period of 
certificates. Additionally, we will implement file path rules, allowing 
different certificates to permit or deny access to different files.

I would like to emphasize that IPE is not meant to replace IMA.

IPE is a different approach, specifically designed for a particular part 
of IMA's capabilities, which is "appraisal. While IPE's approach also 
limits IPE's use cases to highly secure, locked-down devices where 
almost everything is made read-only. In contrast, IMA is a versatile 
solution suitable for a wide range of scenarios, and IPE cannot address 
all of these.

In practice, we often use both IMA (including measurement and appraisal) 
and IPE simultaneously in production. These two solutions can coexist 
and complement each other, and they are not mutually exclusive.

How hard would it be to just apply it to those events?
Userspace doesn't care what the hardware does underneath - it just wants to get
moderately intuitive data back. Having the end user deal with this oddity + even
the need to document it seems to me to be unnecessary burden given how simple it
is (I assume) to remove the oddity.

I was referring to em_cpu_energy() being sched function. No one else
should call it. That's the old contract also put into the doc of
that function.

We have that function called from feec() where the RCU must be hold,
otherwise the whole EAS would be unstable.

I didn't want to add any more overhead in this hot path.

OK, let me check that w/ and w/o lockdebug build and the
SCHED_WARN_ON(!rcu_read_lock_held())

Although, it would be only a safety net for accidental use of
em_cpu_energy() from code path other than feec()...
Which actually might bring some value.

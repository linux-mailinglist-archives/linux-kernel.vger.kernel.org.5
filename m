In the device tree, has PIN_PA13__SDMMC0_CD been removed from the 
pinctrl for sdmmc0?

In case the above behaviour was due to hardware, it would likely point 
out a flaw in the Parallel Input/Output Controller (PIO) rather than in 
the SDMMC Controller.

Would you read back the relevant PIO_CFGRx register, with only "PA13" 
set in PIO_MSKRx, and provide me with the value read?
Assuming PA13 is Non-Secure; if PA13 is configured as Secure, 
S_PIO_CFGRx and S_PIO_MSKRx should be accessed instead.

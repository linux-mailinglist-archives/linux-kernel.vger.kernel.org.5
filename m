The power management method Apple uses to cut power to the FireWire
controller, Thunderbolt controller and discrete GPU is nonstandard.
It's *implemented* in ACPI, but doesn't *conform* to ACPI:  There are
no Power Resources described in the ACPI tables, just custom methods.

This can be made to work on Linux by assigning a dev_pm_domain to the
Root Port above the FireWire controller.  The dev_pm_domain callbacks
cut power to the FireWire controller on ->runtime_suspend() and
reinstate it on ->runtime_resume().  The reason this needs to be done
at the Root Port level is that the PCI core assumes the FireWire
controller is powered on when it calls pci_pm_runtime_resume() for it.
Normally that function would reinstate power through ACPI via
pci_power_up(), but that doesn't work due to the nonstandard nature
of Apple's ACPI tables.

I've implemented this 8 years ago for Thunderbolt but unfortunately
got sidetracked and thus haven't been able to finish upstreaming it yet:

https://github.com/l1k/linux/commit/a53d44439d42

I'm not as familiar with ohci.c as I am (or was) with thunderbolt.ko.
If you could amend ohci.c to call pm_runtime_get() when something is
attached and call pm_runtime_put() when something is detached, I could
look into bringing up the ACPI stuff.  You could acquire one runtime PM
ref for each attached device or just acquire a single ref if *anything*
is connected at all.  Doesn't matter.  But acquiring one ref per attached
device might be simpler.

I would also need a function to perform a bus scan upon runtime resume
which looks for new devices and acquires refs as necessary.  Once that
infrastructure exists, adding the Apple-specific ACPI stuff wouldn't
be too hard for me to do as I could just adapt what I did for Thunderbolt.

Thanks,

Lukas

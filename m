As I mentioned in some of the other sound driver conversions. I believe 
it's possible to completely kill off most workqueues.

However, I donÂ´t have the hardware or knowledge to test it. I saw that 
the SOF had the non-workqueue path already, so it felt less risky to 
simply convert it to always use that path.

avs/skylake drivers should be easy to convert too. This is why I left 
the comment: "Removing the workqueue would simplify init even further, 
but is left as exercise for the reviewer."

HDA-intel has this retry-probe logic used on AMD's,
which makes me more hesitant to convert it.

I wanted to tackle one problem at a time, I believe workqueue removal 
can be done by anyone.

Cheers,
~Maarten

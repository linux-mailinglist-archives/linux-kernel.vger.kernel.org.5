Got it, I will try to hide those BARs both in read and write operations.

You are right, we did not take the power stable cost into account.
T_PVPERL is enough for Lenovo Thinklife ST8000 NVMe SSD to get ready,
and the extra cost is from the power circuit of a PCIe to M.2 connector,
which is used to verify M.2 SSD with our EVB at early stage.

As the Thinklife NVMe SSD may be a halted product,
and the onboard power circuit of VisionFive V2 is no problem,
we decided revert the sleep time to be 100ms.

We will add a comment for the source of T_PVPERL until your define in pci.h is accepted.

Sure, I can add cpuset.cpus.exclusive.effective and allow users to set 
cpuset.cpus.exclusive to whatever they want, just like cpuset.cpus. I 
will rework the patch series and send out a new version sometimes next 
week.

With the new cpuset.cpus.exclusive.effective file, cpuset.cpus.exclusive 
will really be invariant and become whatever the users set. 
cpuset.cpus.exclusive.effective file will only have value if 
cpuset.cpus.exclusive set or it becomes a local partition.

Hopefully this will be the final version.

Cheers,
Longman

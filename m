Yes, exactly that.

On dGPUs it's the VBIOS on a flashrom on the board, for iGPUs (APUs as 
AMD calls them) it's part of the system BIOS.

UEFI is actually just a small subsystem in the system BIOS which 
replaced the old interface used between system BIOS, video BIOS and 
operating system.

I don't know the ast driver well enough to answer that, but I assume 
they just read the BIOS and execute the appropriate functions.

Well POST just means Power On Self Test, but what you mean is 
initializing the hardware.

Some drivers can of course initialize the hardware without the help of 
the BIOS, but I don't think AST can do that. As far as I know it's a 
relatively simple driver.

BTW firmware is not the same as the BIOS (which runs the POST), firmware 
usually refers to something run on microcontrollers inside the ASIC 
while the (system or video) BIOS runs on the host CPU.

Christian.

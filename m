Do we have something like rule or guidance against that?
Looking at the entry in MAINTAINERS, it seems quite normal to me,
I thouht it is generally encourage someone with willing and ability
to be a maintainer/reviewer.

Considering you have refused adding me as the reviewer of page_pool
despite the support from two maintainers of page_pool, for the season
of something like below:
'page pool is increasingly central to the whole networking stack.
The bar for "ownership" is getting higher and higher..'

I think I might need a second opinion here.

I am not a native english speaker here, I would rather not comment
on the 'forced' part here and focus more on the technical disscusion.

+1.
I generally pay more attention to the patch that is to'ed or cc'ed
to my email when I am overloaded with other work.

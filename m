I see, will not mention RCiEP next version.

You are right, two counters, TIME_BASED_ANAL_DATA_REG for time-based
analysis and EVENT_COUNTER_DATA_REG for event counting. And both of them
do not support generate interrupt when the counter overflows.

dwc_pcie_pmu_event_add() now limit the PMU usage to stat event for either
time-based analysis or event counting.

I will extend to support stat them at the same time.

Based on above, I change the word to:

	To facilitate collection of statistics the controller provides the
	following two features for each Root Port:

	- one 64-bit counter for Time Based Analysis (RX/TX data throughput and
	  time spent in each low-power LTSSM state) and
	- one 32-bit counter for Event counting (error and non-error events for
	  a specified lane)

	Note: There is no interrupt for counter overflow.

Thank you for valuable comments.

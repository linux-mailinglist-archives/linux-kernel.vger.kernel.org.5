It is essentially a lock with a timeout, which IIUC we don't support
explicitly in the kernel. What I was trying to do was basically to try
and do a subtree flush, but if we are waiting for too long then a lot
of people are probably flushing, so let's all switch to a root flush
and wait for one flusher instead of contending among ourselves.

If you have N concurrent readers flushing different parts of the
subtree, at some point the overhead of N sequential subtree flushes
will exceed the overhead of a single root flush.

Ideally, we would be able to identify this point, and switch to a
single root flush with everyone else waiting.

This helps only if concurrent flushers are overlapping, right?

I think what you're describing here is v4 of the patchset I mention in
the cover letter:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230831165611.2610118-5-yosryahmed@google.com=
/

The problem with that was that with very high concurrency among
readers, the read latency is unbounded and can get out of hand. Wei
shared some numbers in that thread.

What this patch is trying to do is to switch to root flushing if the
mutex is contended to avoid that scenario.  Also, if we keep acquiring
more flushers at some point we just skip the flush in favor of
performance (if the number of waiters exceeds the number of cpus). Now
that I think about it, perhaps we can just go back to the mutex
approach w/ limiting the number of waiters, without ever falling back
to a root flush. Not sure how that would work.

Taking a step back, I think what you are implying is that if we make
the thresholding code per cpu instead of global, this should mitigate
the issue in a different way than falling back to root flushing or
limiting the number of waiters, is that right?
If yes, I think it will work in some cases where the flushes are
overlapping as I mentioned above, but not if concurrent readers are
flushing different parts of the tree. Right?

I think we are talking about different paths. I believe you are
talking about resetting memcg->stat_delta, which I agree should be
done during the flush. What I am talking about is updating
memcg->stat_delta when memcg_rstat_updated() is called. We would need
to update that for all parents. In your example hierarchy, if stat
updates happened in a2, and someone tries to flush a, they should be
aware that there are stats to flush.

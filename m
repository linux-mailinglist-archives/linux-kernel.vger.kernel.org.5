My understanding is that this patch is about reducing overlap of
capabilities.

Allowing the same thing with more capabilities seems to go against
the idea of separate capabilities.

Kernel has printed the warning for 13 years. It is a long
time to fix configuration for newly installed systems. And I doubt
that anyone is installing a new kernel on 13 year's old system.

IMHO, this fits into the category that it should be OK until
anyone complains. But I might miss something.

Petr

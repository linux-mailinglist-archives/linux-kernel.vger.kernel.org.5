I linked to the wrong docs btw: here is the right one:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.15/block/capability.html

Quoting:

        This file documents the sysfs file block/<disk>/capability.

        capability is a bitfield, printed in hexadecimal, indicating
        which capabilities a specific block device supports:

        â€¦

        GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN (0x0200): partition scanning is disabled. Used
        for loop devices in their default settings and some MMC devices.

We used the flag 0x200 in systemd. i.e. followed the docs, and it
worked back when we added this.

Ah, so this ws already broken once
before... 430cc5d3ab4d0ba0bd011cfbb0035e46ba92920c

So the documented API was not just broken completely once but twice?

Good to know.

1. GENHD_FL_NO_PART(_SCAN) was originally documented as 0x200.

2. GENHD_FL_MEDIA_CHANGE_NOTIFY was originally documented as 4.

3. And then GENHD_FL_NO_PART(_SCAN) got redefined to 4 in
   430cc5d3ab4d0ba0bd011cfbb0035e46ba92920c.

All that even though this is documented API which is still up on
kernel.org?

Not sure how this is salvageable. This is just seriously fucked
up. What now?

It has been proposed to use the "range_ext" sysfs attr instead as a
hint if partition scanning is available or not. But it's entirely
undocumented. Is this something that will remain stable? (I mean,
whether something is documented or not apparently has no effect on the
stability of an API anyway, so I guess it's equally shaky as the
capability sysattr? Is any of the block device sysfs interfaces
actually stable or can they change any time?)

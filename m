Well that's pretty much all Intel Titan Ridge and Maple Ridge based
systems. Some early ones did not use IOMMU but all the rest do.

Before Intel Ice Lake it was all discrete and it is still discrete with
the Barlow Ridge controller who will have exact same ExternalFacing port
as the previous models.

Do we have such security policy in the mainline kernel?

Or perhaps the "policy" should know this better? IIRC there were some
"exceptions" in the Chrome kernel that allowed to put these devices into
"allowlist" is this not the case anymore?

This is actually accurate. The Thunderbolt controller is itself
hot-removable and that BTW happens to be hot-removed when fwupd applies
firmware upgrades to the device.

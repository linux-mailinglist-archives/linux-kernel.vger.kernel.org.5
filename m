Ok, I got the issue. TBH, I added the device tree property based on the existing
quirks for the ACPI devices. But none of the DT based platforms I'm aware of
(even the legacy Qcom MSM8996 chipset released in early 2016) doesn't have any
issue with D3hot. But I'm just nervous to assume it is the case for all the DT
based platforms in the wild.

But to proceed further, what is your preference? Should we ammend the DT
property to make it explicit that the propery only focuses on the D3hot
capability of the bridge and it works as per the spec (PMCSR) or bite the bullet
and enable D3hot for all the non-ACPI platforms?

We can add quirks for the bridges later on if we happen to receive any bug
report.

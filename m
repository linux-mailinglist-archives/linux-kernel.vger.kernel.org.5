I don't follow why this has to be done globally. resctrl allows CLOSID to have different
configurations for different purposes between different domains (as long as tasks are
pinned to CPUs). It feels a bit odd that these counters can't be considered as per-domain too.

MPAM can equally allocate monitors/counters per-domain. If we are ever going to have
per-domain assignment, I think its worth the extra work to do that now and avoid the extra
user-space interface baggage from the global version.

string parsing in the kernel is rarely fun!

If this file were re-used for finding where the monitors were currently allocated, using
the name would be a natural fit for building a path to un-assign one group.

Do we know if this exists? Given the configurations have to be different for a domain, I'd
be surprised if counter configuration is somehow distributed between domains.

What do you mean by 'how much', is this allow to fail early? That feels a bit
counter-intuitive. As this starts with a reset, if the number of counters is known - it
should be easy for user-space to know it can only write X tokens into that file.


Thanks,

James

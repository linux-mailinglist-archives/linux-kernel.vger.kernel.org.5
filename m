Okay, I'll look into changing the code towards that direction. The small=20
trouble there is that soon I've very little that can be configured away=20
from the bandwidth controller because this quirk already relates to the=20
target speed changing code and the LBMS will require the other side to be=
=20
always compiled too...

I also thought suspend as one possibility but yes, it racy. Mika also=20
suggested clearing LBMS after each successful retrain but that wouldn't=20
cover all possible ways to get LBMS set as devices can set it=20
independently of OS. Keeping it cleared constantly is pretty much what=20
will happen with the bandwidth controller anyway.

A small correction here, the quirk didn't trigger initially for the=20
device, it does that only after resume. And even then quirk is called=20
only because the link doesn't come up.

On longer term, I'd actually want to have hotplug resumed earlier so the=20
disconnect could be detected before/while all this waiting related to link=
=20
up is done. But that's very complicated to realize in practice because=20
hotplug lurks behind portdrv so resuming it earlier isn't going to be=20
about just moving a few lines around.

That's a good question and I don't have an answer to this yet, that is,
I don't fully understand what happens to those device during runtime=20
suspend/resume cycle and what is the exact mechanism that preserves the=20
LBMS bit, I'll look more into it.

But I agree that if the device goes cold enough and downstream is=20
disconnected, the port should no longer have a way to reassert LBMS.

> Of course once set the bit isn't self-clearing except at power-up/reset.

Okay, I misunderstood you meant it would be self-clearing whenever=20
DL_Down happens. I can see that could have been one possible=20
interpretation of the text fragment in the spec.

I'd guess it probably sets the bit on each try, or perhaps only on the=20
subset of tries which were "successful" before the link almost immediately=
=20
runs into another error (that 16% of the time).

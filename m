There is no documented conventions like this. Probably one has to add some,
let's say, recommendations.

This way (alphabetical ordering and grouping) it is easier to maintain and
in long term makes easier (less possible conflicts) when backporting.

I agree with this, but we have many maintainers and reviewers and some
ask one way, the others another way and so on... Without documentation
one can use a common sense and rationale behind it.

I don't really care about blank lines (however grouping is still done
as of today in this file), but I do care about ordering and grouping.

Do you have such examples IRL?

In any case, how would you satisfy the maintainer's request which asks for
sorting?

I have no objections for this way (doing it in a two separate changes).
With the proposed you can satisfy any maintainer basically. Ones who
do not want sorting, may skip that patch, indeed.

Actually there is a rising trend to follow clang-format.
I have no idea what it does, but my rationale is explained above.

Yes, please do.

So, let's have above with one or two patches.

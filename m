Interesting. Not sure how your partially zeroed-out buffers could happen
with fully buffered IO.

Within the same page buffered reads and writes should be consistent because
they are synchronized by the page lock. However once reads and writes
involve multiple pages, there is no serialization so you can get contents
of some pages before write and some pages after being written. However this
doesn't seem to be your particular case here. I just wanted to point out
that in general even buffered reads vs writes are not fully consistent.

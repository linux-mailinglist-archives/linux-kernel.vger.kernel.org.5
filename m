Yes, that's the problem AFAICS.  Dave?

What about moving the fw_table.h include in linux/acpi.h below the
mutex.h one, along with the EXPORT_SYMBOL_ACPI_LIB-related
definitions?

BTW, I'm not really sure why fw_table.h needs to include both
linux/acpi.h and acpi/acpi.h, because it should get the latter through
the former anyway.

There are exceptions, but generally you are right.

Something like that.

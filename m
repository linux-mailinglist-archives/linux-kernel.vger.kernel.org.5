I'm not sure that you described the problem in a way that I can understand, here.

After dsa_tag_8021q_bridge_join():
-> dsa_port_tag_8021q_vlan_add(dp, bridge_vid)
-> dsa_port_tag_8021q_vlan_del(dp, standalone_vid)

it's *expected* that there should be only one untagged/pvid per port: the bridge_vid.

For context, consider the fact that you can run the following commands:

bridge vlan add dev eth0 vid 10 pvid
bridge vlan add dev eth0 vid 11 pvid

and after the second command, vid 10 stops being a pvid.

So I think that the "Port %d can have only one pvid! Now is: %d.\n" behavior
is not correct. You need to implement the pvid overwriting behavior, since
there's always only 1 pvid.

So that leaves the "untagged" flag as being problematic, correct? Could
you comment...

... on this? Here I'm pointing out that "all VLANs have the egress-untagged flag"
is a configuration that can actually be supported by vsc73xx. You just
need to ensure that VSC73XX_TXUPDCFG_TX_INSERT_TAG is 0. And tag_8021q
basically requests exactly that configuration on user ports (both the
bridge_vid and the standalone_vid are egress-untagged). So your check is
too restrictive, you are denying a configuration that would work.
The problem only appears when you mix egress-tagged with egress-untagged
VLANs on a port. Only then there can be at most 1 egress-untagged VID,
because you need to enable VSC73XX_TXUPDCFG_TX_INSERT_TAG for the
egress-tagged VIDs to work.

I'm not sure if that was a compliment :) At least in this form, it's
certainly non-trivial to determine by looking at the code if it is
correct or not, and it uses different patterns than the other VLAN
implementations in DSA drivers. Generally, boring and obvious is
preferable. But after I took the time to understand, it seems plausible
that the approach might work.

Let's see how the same idea looks, cleaned up a bit but not redesigned,
in v4.

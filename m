This is an incorrect assumption.

drm_aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_framebuffers() and co don't kill the 
framebuffer, they just remove the current framebuffer driver to avoid 
further updates.

So what happens (at least for amdgpu) is that we take over the 
framebuffer, including both mode and it's contents, and provide a new 
framebuffer interface until DRM masters like X or Wayland take over.

Well, you don't seem to understand the background here. This is 
perfectly normal behavior.

Secondary cards are posted after loading the appropriate DRM driver. At 
least for amdgpu this is done by calling the appropriate functions in 
the BIOS.

As far as I know this is expected as well. AST is a relatively simple 
driver and when it's not the primary one during boot the assumption is 
that it isn't used at all.

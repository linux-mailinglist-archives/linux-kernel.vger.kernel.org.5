No, the point is that dma_map_single() uses virt_to_page(), and 
virt_to_page() is definitely not valid for vmalloc addresses. At worst 
it may blow up in itself with an out-of-bounds dereference; at best it's 
going to return a completely bogus page pointer which may then make 
dma_map_page() fall over.

Thanks,
Robin.

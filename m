The current design of cgroup_rstat_cpu_pop_updated() is to traverse
the updated tree in a way to pop out the leaf nodes first before
their parents. This can cause traversal of multiple nodes before a
leaf node can be found and popped out. IOW, a given node in the tree
can be visited multiple times before the whole operation is done. So
it is not very efficient and the code can be hard to read.

With the introduction of cgroup_rstat_updated_list() to build a list
of cgroups to be flushed first before any flushing operation is being
done, we can optimize the way the updated tree nodes are being popped
by pushing the parents first to the tail end of the list before their
children. In this way, most updated tree nodes will be visited only
once with the exception of the subtree root as we still need to go
back to its parent and popped it out of its updated_children list.
This also makes the code easier to read.

A parallel kernel build on a 2-socket x86-64 server is used as the
benchmarking tool for measuring the lock hold time. Below were the lock
hold time frequency distribution before and after the patch:

     Hold time        Before patch       After patch
     ---------        ------------       -----------
       0-01 us        13,738,708         14,594,545
      01-05 us         1,177,194            439,926
      05-10 us             4,984              5,960
      10-15 us             3,562              3,543
      15-20 us             1,314              1,397
      20-25 us                18                 25
      25-30 us                12                 12

It can be seen that the patch pushes the lock hold time towards the
lower end.

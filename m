I agree it's better to not [try to] list all the possibilities, assuming
we can come up with good, general words to capture the idea.

We'll have plenty of S-mode extensions listed in these strings. Users
who recognize S-mode extensions may want to know if they're listed because
the kernel is applying them (and wouldn't be listed otherwise), or whether
they're listed simply because they exist on the hart(s).

If there weren't S-mode extensions being listed, then I would agree,
but, since there are, it seems odd to not explain what it means for
them to be there wrt host and guest kernels.

I guess the guidance you're referring to is the "(__riscv_hwprobe() should
be queried for userspace usability.  The hypervisor should be queried,
using hypervisor-specific APIs, to check guest kernel usability.)" bit.
I'm fine with dropping that or moving it to another section, but I think
the more we point out hwprobe, the better. If developers are reading this
/proc/cpuinfo section because they want to detect extensions, then I'd
prefer the section redirects them to hwprobe.

or guest kernels in the case of S-mode extensions.

I'm not sure about the word "disabled". The kernel can only disable U-mode
extensions and S-mode extensions for guests. S-mode extensions for the
current kernel would have to be disabled by its next higher privilege
level.

How about "...may not recognize the extension, or may have deliberately
removed it from the listing."

(But then readers will wonder why an extension would be deliberately
removed from the listing, which brings us back to trying to come up
with general words to capture the cases I listed. Or, maybe we don't
have to care if they wonder why in this section/document.)

Thanks,

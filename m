This makes no sense. As Bjorn already said, you're just polling for the
link to come up (for a second). And unless you have something else that
depends on the write to have reached the device, there is no need to
read it back. It's not going to be cached indefinitely if that's what
you fear.

Again no, there is no general need to do that. It all depends on what
the code does and how the device works.

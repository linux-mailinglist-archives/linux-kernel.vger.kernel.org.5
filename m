Have been running for a few weeks now. The earliest vanilla-kernel I 
have ben able to reproduce the issue with is 6.2.16, it only happened 
once over two weeks.

The issue still happens frequently on 6.4.x kernels. Here is the output 
from 6.4.7, and as you see happened only a few seconds after booting. 
This VM has only a minimal system installed:

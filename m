If I understand the doucmentation at [1] correctly, the first round of
testing starts with -rc1 and ends with -rc2, so if the feature is not
merged by -rc2, it won't make that release cycle. I think counted_by
might be a hard sell even after -rc1 because the feature is not exactly
small but it is also not expansive (it is relatively self contained
from what I can tell). So I think your plan is reasonable.

Another alternative would be to split this patch in to three distinct
patches, not sure if that would be overkill for this though.

1. Update the clang review link from reviews.llvm.org to github.com
2. Update the GCC version from 14 to 15.
3. Update the Clang version from 18 to 19.

The first two patches could be picked up immediately and the third one
could be sat on to see how the review and acceptance process works out
over the next couple of weeks. Up to you/Sergey. Thanks for taking a
look!

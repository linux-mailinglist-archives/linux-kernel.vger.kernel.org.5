Sorry I didn't have the full story in mind, I had to do my homework.
One example is userspace OOM killing. Our userspace OOM killer makes
decisions based on some stats from memory.stat, and stale stats (a few
seconds in this case) can result in an unrightful OOM kill, which can
easily cascade.

A simplified example of that is when a hierarchy has a parent cgroup
with multiple related children. In this case, there are usually
file-backed resources that are shared between those children, and OOM
killing one of them will not free those resources. Hence, the OOM
killer only considers their anonymous usage to be reap-able when a
memcg is nuked. For that we use the "anon" stat (or "rss" in cgroup
v1) in memory.stat.

People also care when something gets less accurate :)

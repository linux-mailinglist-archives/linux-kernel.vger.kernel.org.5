The cover letter says:
"Previously, this exact interface addition was proposed by Yosry[3]."

So I think it should be acknowledged with a Suggested-by, based on:
"A Suggested-by: tag indicates that the patch idea is suggested by the
person named and ensures credit to the person for the idea."

Using a pointer to indicate whether the type it points to is
overridden isn't really a good practice.

A better alternative was suggested during the v2:
"Perhaps the negative to avoid unnecessary dereferences."
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/dhhjw4h22q4ngwtxmhuyifv32zjd6z2relrcjgnxsw=
6zys3mod@o6dh5dy53ae3/

Since only proactive reclaim can override swappiness, meaning it only
happens if sc->proactive is true, I think the best way to make it work
without spending much effort is create a helper as Michal suggest but
it should look like:

sc_swappiness()
{
  return sc->proactive ? sc->swappiness : mem_cgroup_swappiness(memcg);
}

In this patchset, sc->swappiness really means
sc->proactive_swappiness. So it should be renamed accordingly.

Yes, I mean only this patch. I want to fix memory corruption fast, while
waiting for more feedback on my understanding of the alignment masks.
What I'm trying to say is that your specific use case may not even need
a bigger allocation if the page alignment should be interpreted differently.

Again, thank you for your in-depth inspection, because it's not totally
clear how the various alignment parameters should be interpreted. It's
difficult to write correct code then...

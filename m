For net stack part, I believe your patch below is handling to aovid those
mm calls? I don't include it in this patchset as I thought it is obvious
that whatever the proposal is, we always need those checking.
Maybe we should have included it to avoid this kind of confusion.

For driver part, I was thinking if the driver supports devmem, it should check
that if it can call page_address() related call on a specific 'stuct page', or
maybe we should introduce a new helper to make it obvious?

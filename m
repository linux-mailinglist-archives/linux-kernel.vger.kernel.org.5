Trying to understand exactly what "relaxed window tail sizing rules"
means.

Previous calculation "based on the required alignment of the largest
resource among downstream resources."  If a 16GiB BAR and a 16MiB BAR
leads to a 32GiB window, obviously we need a 16GiB-aligned area.  Are
you saying we also require the *size* to be 16GiB aligned?  So we add
16GiB + 16MiB to get the required size, then round it up to a 16GiB
multiple?

And "relaxed window tail" means what?  I guess we don't require as
much alignment of the size?

Obviously we need at least 1MiB alignment because that's how bridge
windows work.  If downstream resources could be packed, e.g., sort
them into descending size, align window to size of largest downstream
resource, assign smaller ones adjacent to preceding larger ones, it
should be a minimal size.

But I assume we have to do this individually for each bridge level,
including any BARs at that level along with bridge windows to the next
level downstream.

Does "relaxed window tail sizing" mean we don't allocate any more
space than is strictly required for the BARs currently present?

I guess the relaxed rules are required because this window doesn't fit
inside some upstream window?  Maybe include the upstream window in the
example here.  In the code, do we know the upstream window at this
point?  If so, maybe the message could include it?

But I'm missing something because it looks like we assigned the same
window (0x6000000000-0x6400ffffff) below.  What exactly is different?
It looks like the 02:01.0 windows below are the same as the ones where
it failed above.

Nit, I think if these examples were collected from a newer kernel,
"reg 0x10" would be replaced with "BAR 0" so the messages would be
slightly easier to read.

I guess this returns 0 on success, right?  But more comments below.

I would test "find_empty_resource_slot(...) == 0" since it doesn't
return a boolean.

IIUC, when find_empty_resource_slot() returns 0, it fills in
gap.start/end/flags.  Is there anything useful we can do with that
information, e.g., a dbg log message?

I think find_empty_resource_slot() doesn't actually *allocate* the
space, right?  So there would be a race between this and the
allocation in pci_claim_resource(), except that there's nobody else
allocating in this hierarchy because ...?

The IORESOURCE_PREFETCH here -- does that just mean that "type" must
match exactly, including whether IORESOURCE_PREFETCH is set or not?

I guess pbus_upstream_assigned_limit() being true (-ENOSPC) basically
means there's no available space for "size0, add_align" in the
upstream window?

Since it's used as a predicate, I wonder if it could return true/false
and be named something like "pbus_upstream_space_available()" and test
it with "!pbus_upstream_space_available()" here?

> +		min_align = 1ULL << (max_order + 20);

We never had any comments about what "max_order" means.  I vaguely
remember it's basically in 1MB units because of these:

  resource_size_t aligns[24]; /* Alignments from 1MB to 8TB */

  * aligns[0] is for 1MB (since bridge memory
  * windows are always at least 1MB aligned), so
  * keep "order" from being negative for smaller
  * resources.

Is there any hint we can give in the message about what "relaxed

Perhaps that also means it's not a problem in practice, or at least I hope =

Unfortunately, it's more difficult than this. I thought about breaking
down that lock and falled back to this solution. See below.

Right, we needed an atomic interface for flushing, but that later
turned out to cause some problems, so we reworked the code such that
we never have to flush atomically. Now we can go back to the mutex if
it makes things better, I am not really sure how much it helps though.

Maybe not for this specific case because it's a global mutex and
holding it for too long might cause problems? Is it bad to disable
preemption while holding a mutex?

The problem is that the global lock also serializes the global
counters that we flush to. I will talk from the memcg flushing
perspective as that's what I am familiar with. I am not sure how much
this is transferable to other flushers.

On the memcg side (see mem_cgroup_css_rstat_flush()), the global lock
synchronizes access to multiple counters, for this discussion what's
most important are:
- The global stat counters of the memcg being flushed (e.g.
memcg->vmstats->state).
- The pending stat counters of the parent being flushed (e.g.
parent->vmstats->state_pending).

To get rid of this lock, we either need to use atomics for those
counters, or have fine-grained locks. I experimented a while back with
atomic and flushing was significantly more expensive. The number of
atomic operations would scale with O(# cgroups * # cpus) and can grow
unbounded.

The other option is fine-grained locks. In this case we would need to
lock both the memcg being flushed and its parent together. This can go
wrong with ordering, and for top-level memcgs the root memcg lock will
become the new global lock anyway. One way to overcome this is to
change the parent's pending stat counters to also be percpu. This will
increase the memory usage of the stat counters per-memcg, by hundreds
of bytes per cpu.

Let's assume that's okay, so we only need to lock one cgroup at a
time. There are more problems.

We also have a percpu lock (cgroup_rstat_cpu_lock), which we use to
lock the percpu tree which has the cgroups that have updates on this
cpu. It is held by both flushing contexts and updating contexts (hot
paths). Ideally we don't want to spin on a per-cgroup (non percpu)
lock while holding the percpu lock, as flushers of different cpus will
start blocking one another, as well as blocking updaters. On the other
hand, we need to hold percpu lock to pop a cgroup from that tree and
lock it. It's a chicken and egg problem. Also, if we release the
percpu lock while flushing, we open another can of worms:
(a) Concurrent updates can keep updating the tree putting us in an
endless flushing loop. We need some sort of generation tracking for
this.
(b) Concurrent flushing can flush a parent prematurely on the same cpu
as we are flushing a child, and not get the updates from the child.

One possible scheme to handle the above is as follows:
1. Hold the percpu lock, find the cgroup that needs to be flushed next.
2. Trylock that cgroup. If we succeed, we flush it with both the
percpu and the per-cgroup locks held.
3. If we fail, release the percpu lock and spin on the per-cgroup lock.
4. When we get the per-cgroup lock, take the percpu lock again, and
make sure that the locked cgroup is still the correct cgroup to flush.
If not, repeat.
5. Flush the cgroup, and go back to step 1 to get the next cgroup.

Of course this is complex and error-prone, and might introduce
significant overheads due to the number of locks we need to take
compared with what we currently have.

I guess what I am trying to say is, breaking down that lock is a major
surgery that might require re-designing or re-implementing some parts
of rstat. I would be extremely happy to be proven wrong. If we can
break down that lock then there is no need for unified flushing even
for in-kernel contexts, and we can all live happily ever after with
cheap(ish) and accurate stats flushing.

I really hope we can move forward with the problems at hand (sometimes
reads are expensive, sometimes reads are stale), and not block fixing
them until we can come up with an alternative to that global lock
(unless, of course, there is a simpler way of doing that).

Sorry for the very long reply :)

Thanks!

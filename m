Doing above was my first thought too when we were discussing
the issue internally. But I am glad the discussions happened with Jan to
understand the right reason behing MAP_NEW flag. 

While at it we also noticed that the ext4_map_blocks() returns different
map->m_flags set for the same extent type when passed with different flags
in it's argument :). So it quickly become confusing. Thanks for sorting
out the unknowns.

This patch looks good to me too! Feel free to add -

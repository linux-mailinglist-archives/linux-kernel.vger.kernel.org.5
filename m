Sorry for my poor choice of words yet again. I meant VM kernel(running
as NS virtual endpoint) with OPTEE driver running in it as secondary
scheduler. IIUC, there will be another instance of OPTEE driver in the
primary scheduler endpoint(i.e. host kernel) and it will take care of
running SRI handler ?

Fair enough

Agreed.

OK

Understood. I will take a look at the patch with the above information.

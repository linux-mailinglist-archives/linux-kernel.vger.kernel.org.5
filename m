Yes, that's probably a good idea.

I think we can skip this one. The loop is for traversing from the
charging cgroup to the one that has memory.high set and breached, and
then reclaim it. It's not expected to run multiple reclaims.

Yeah this is the better place for this check.

How about this?

Subject: [PATCH] mm: memcontrol: don't throttle dying tasks on memory.high

While investigating hosts with high cgroup memory pressures, Tejun
found culprit zombie tasks that had were holding on to a lot of
memory, had SIGKILL pending, but were stuck in memory.high reclaim.

In the past, we used to always force-charge allocations from tasks
that were exiting in order to accelerate them dying and freeing up
their rss. This changed for memory.max in a4ebf1b6ca1e ("memcg:
prohibit unconditional exceeding the limit of dying tasks"); it noted
that this can cause (userspace inducable) containment failures, so it
added a mandatory reclaim and OOM kill cycle before forcing charges.
At the time, memory.high enforcement was handled in the userspace
return path, which isn't reached by dying tasks, and so memory.high
was still never enforced by dying tasks.

When c9afe31ec443 ("memcg: synchronously enforce memory.high for large
overcharges") added synchronous reclaim for memory.high, it added
unconditional memory.high enforcement for dying tasks as well. The
callstack shows that this path is where the zombie is stuck in.

We need to accelerate dying tasks getting past memory.high, but we
cannot do it quite the same way as we do for memory.max: memory.max is
enforced strictly, and tasks aren't allowed to move past it without
FIRST reclaiming and OOM killing if necessary. This ensures very small
levels of excess. With memory.high, though, enforcement happens lazily
after the charge, and OOM killing is never triggered. A lot of
concurrent threads could have pushed, or could actively be pushing,
the cgroup into excess. The dying task will enter reclaim on every
allocation attempt, with little hope of restoring balance.

To fix this, skip synchronous memory.high enforcement on dying tasks
altogether again. Update memory.high path documentation while at it.

Yes, it should be fixed upstream.  You will need these two commits:

commit deba78709ae8ce103e2248413857747f804cd1ef
Author: Richard Henderson <richard.henderson@linaro.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 6 17:55:48 2023 +0100

    accel/tcg: Always lock pages before translation

commit cb62bd15e14e304617d250158b77d0deb032f032
Author: Richard Henderson <richard.henderson@linaro.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 6 08:45:13 2023 +0100

    accel/tcg: Split out cpu_exec_longjmp_cleanup

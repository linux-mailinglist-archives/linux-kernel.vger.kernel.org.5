I was thinking about that as well but the commit block looks like:

truct commit_header {
        __be32          h_magic;
        __be32          h_blocktype;
        __be32          h_sequence;
        unsigned char   h_chksum_type;
        unsigned char   h_chksum_size;
        unsigned char   h_padding[2];
        __be32          h_chksum[JBD2_CHECKSUM_BYTES];
        __be64          h_commit_sec;
        __be32          h_commit_nsec;
};

where JBD2_CHECKSUM_BYTES is 8. So all the data in the commit block
including the checksum is in the first 60 bytes. Hence I would be really
surprised if some storage can tear that...

Hence either Ye Bin is running on some really exotic storage or the storage
/ CPU in fact flipped bits somewhere so that the checksum didn't match or
the commit block was in fact not written now but it was a leftover from
previous journal use and h_sequence happened to match. Very unlikely but
depending on how exactly they do their powerfail testing I can imagine it
would be possible with enough tries...

Yeah, I agree in these cases of a corrupted journal it seems dangerous to
just try to continue without fsck based on some heuristics.

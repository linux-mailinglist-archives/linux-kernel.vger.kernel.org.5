Sorry for that, it occurred because I aimed to split a patch that 
specifically addressed a problem I identified, versus my entire patch set.

I'll keep that feedback in mind going forward.

My reasoning behind using "now" is that, by the time taprio_start_sched() 
is called, "maybe" the entry has already runâ€”up to 80% of its total 
duration, for example. So, if an extension is needed for this last entry, 
wouldn't it be more accurate to calculate the remaining 20% of the entry 
duration plus the duration to the new base time? That's the idea behind the 
calculation above.

In contrast, in the case of extension in `advance_sched()`, gate durations 
during correction are calculated using the full interval duration. This is 
because the entry hasn't run yet and will run for the entire interval 
duration. Hence, the logic in the code below makes sense for advance_sched():
      u64 new_gate_duration = next->interval + oper->cycle_time_correction;


Let me know what you think, my interpretation of what value gate_duration 
should be, in this scenario, could be wrong.

Hmm, I usually try to follow that that reverse Christmas tree style, but in 
this scenario, ensuring the proper initialization value for the local 
variable seemed more important to me than adhering to that style.

I wasn't aware it was a set-in-stone kind of rule.
I'll make the change accordingly then.

Actually, it follows a similar logic to the earlier patches:
"net/sched: taprio: fix cycle time adjustment for next entry" and 
"net/sched: taprio: update impacted fields during cycle time adjustment." 
Those patches also involved recalculating gate duration with cycle time 
correction.

Skipping the update for max_open_gate_duration means max_sdu value will be 
incorrect. Neglecting gate_duration means entry->budget[tc] won't get the 
correct update. Both of these affect taprio_dequeue_from_txq() and 
taprio_enqueue().

By the way, weren't all these consequences part of your original concern in 
the comment back in v1?

The only difference in this patch is that it's handling the "current entry" 
instead of the "next entry" - like in advance_sched().

Considered that, but it's not as doable as it seems.

I can't toss all of these into a single function and call it for both 
because there are some differences to navigate.
The common functions being called are taprio_update_queue_max_sdu(), 
update_open_gate_duration(), and taprio_set_budgets().
However, advance_sched() doesn't call update_gate_close_time(), and there 
are some differences in the order of where it's called in advance_sched().

Nevertheless, I'm all ears for suggestion on the common function.

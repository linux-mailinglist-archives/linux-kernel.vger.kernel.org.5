IIUC, the PMU is directly integrated into the Root Port: it's
discovered and operated via the Root Port config space.  If so, I
wouldn't bother mentioning RCiEP because there's no need to list all
the things it's *not*.

Certainly a reasonable assumption :)

But I'm confused about how many counters there are.  Clearly there are
two features ((1) time-based analysis and (2) event counters).

"One counter for each type" suggests there's one counter for
time-based analysis and a second counter for event counting, but from
dwc_pcie_pmu_event_add(), it looks like each Root Port might have a
single counter, and you can decide whether that counter is used for
time-based analysis or event counting, but you can't do both at the
same time?  And the event counting is for a single lane, not for the
link as a whole?

If so, I might word this as:

  Each Root Port contains one counter that can be used for either:

    - Time-Based Analysis (RX/TX data throughput and time spent in
      each low-power LTSSM state) or

    - Event counting (error and non-error events for a specified lane)

  There is no interrupt for counter overflow.

Perfect :)

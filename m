Fair enough.

The PE header happens to have a checksum field that a) is not used by
EFI at all, and b) is not covered by the signature. So it wouldn't be
too hard to put a doctored value in that field that forces the CRC-32
of the entire image to 0xffff_ffff *after* signing, and this would
even work if the image did not have a CRC-32 at the end in the first
place. (So the signing tools wouldn't need to know whether they are
signing a x86 bzImage or some other PE executable). Note that pesign
and sbsign currently follow the PE/windows spec for generating this
checksum, but EFI never looks at it. (It is documented as being
intended for checksumming critical system DLLs on Windows)

But that is a lot of trouble for no known use case, so let's not
bother with that right now. But I'll withdraw this patch from the
series.

Thanks,
Ard.

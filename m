1.
With this patch, platforms like the Juno which:
- don't set a `transition_delay_us`
- have a high `transition_latency` (> 1ms)
can request freq. changes every 2ms.

If a platform has a `transition_latency` > 2ms, this means:
   `transition_latency` > `transition_delay_us`
I.e. a second freq. requests might be emitted before the first one
will be completed. On the Juno, this doesn't cause any 'real' issue
as the SCMI/mailbox mechanism works well, but this doesn't seem
correct.
If the util of CPUs is in between OPPs (i.e. freq. changes are often
required), the Juno:
- sends a freq. request
- waits for completion and schedules another task in the meantime
- upon completion, immediately sends a new freq.

I think that the following should be respected/checked:
- `transition_latency` < `transition_delay_us`
(it might also make sense to have, with K being any factor:)
- `transition_latency` * K < `transition_delay_us`


2.
There are references to the 10ms values at other places in the code:

include/linux/cpufreq.h
  * ondemand governor will work on any processor with transition latency <= 10ms,

drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq.c
  * For platforms that can change the frequency very fast (< 10
  * us), the above formula gives a decent transition delay. But
-> the 10us value matches 10ms = 10us * LATENCY_MULTIPLIER

Documentation/admin-guide/pm/cpufreq.rst
  Typically, it is set to values of the order of 10000 (10 ms).  Its
  default value is equal to the value of ``cpuinfo_transition_latency``


3.
There seems to be a dependency of the conservative/ondemand governors
over the the value returned by `cpufreq_policy_transition_delay_us()`:

drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_governor.c
   dbs_data->sampling_rate = max_t(unsigned int,
     CPUFREQ_DBS_MIN_SAMPLING_INTERVAL,            // = 2 * tick period = 8ms
     cpufreq_policy_transition_delay_us(policy));  // [1]: val <= 2ms

[1]
if `transition_latency` is not set and `transition_delay_us` is,
which is the case for the Juno.

The `sampling_rate` is, FYIU, the period used to evaluate the ratio
of the idle/busy time, and if necessary increase/decrease the freq.

This patch will likely reduce this sampling rate from 10ms -> 8ms
(if `cpufreq_policy_transition_delay_us()`` now returns 2ms for some
platforms). This is not much, but just wanted to note it.

Regards,
Pierre

I'll try to explain briefly.

On *some* MediaTek platforms, there are two *identical* PLLs for HDMI/(e)DP,
which are internal to the SoC; clocks for HDMI/eDP/DP controller*s* can be
parented either PLL (as you see from this commit).

The PLL's rate can be changed in runtime and you want to use PLL dividers to
get the final pixel clock (that's to obviously reduce the PLL jitter).

Would be fine... but more complicated I think?

We want the clocks to be reparented, as we need them to switch parents as
explained before... that's more or less how the tree looks:

TVDPLL(x) -> PLL Divider (fixed) -> MUX -> Gate -> Controller

Besides, I think that forcing *one* parent to the dp/edp mux would produce a
loss of the flexibility that the clock framework provides.

I again want to emphasize on the fact that TVDPLL1 and TVDPLL2 are *identical*
in specs, and on that there will never be a MT8195 SoC that has only one of
the two PLLs, for obvious reasons...

P.S.: If you need more context, I'll be glad to answer to any other question!

Cheers,
Angelo

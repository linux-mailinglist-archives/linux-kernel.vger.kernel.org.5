I suspect nobody has just considered a malfunctioning or adversary

Yes, that would be interesting to hear.

I would have a very daring question. Do we really need a global lock in
the first place? AFAIU this locks serializes (kinda as the lock can be
dropped midway) flushers and cgroup_rstat_flush_hold/release caller (a
single one ATM). I can see cgroup_base_stat_cputime_show would like to
have a consistent view on multiple stats but can we live without a
strong guarantee or to replace the lock with seqlock instead?

Reading 0fa294fb1985 ("cgroup: Replace cgroup_rstat_mutex with a spinlock")
it seems the point of moving away from mutex was to have a more usable
API.

No, not really. It is expected that holder of mutex can sleep and can be
preempted as well.

I might be wrong but the whole discussion so far suggests that the
global rstat lock should be reconsidered. From my personal experience
global locks easily triggerable from the userspace are just a receip for
problems. Stats reading shouldn't be interfering with the system runtime
as much as possible and they should be deterministic wrt runtime as
well.

Where does it say "code" in the Documentation? As I read it, the doc weighs both
code and comment as "statement".

And how on the world that breaking a single word to the next line improves
readability? I fail to get it :/

May you should fix yours to extend the limit to 100?

But I do not want to get into a spat here. Checkpatch, the tool supposed to
check for the kernel coding style is not complaining and I do not want a patch
that _fixes_ a coding style that is not an issue.

And I do not want to argue more on this. If the PCI maintainers are comfortable
with this patch, they can apply it, but I'm not.

This we agree and it's what I tried to write above.

It's a bit complicated. I honestly don't know what is the best approach=20
here so I'm very much open to your suggestion what would be preferrable.

There are two main use cases (more than two callers but they seem boil=20
down to two use cases).

One use case is reset related functions and those would probably prefer to=
=20
have error returned if the wait, and thus reset, failed.

Then the another is wait for buses, that is,=20
pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() which return 0 if there's no device=20
(wait successful). For it, it would make sense to return 0 also when=20
device is disconnected because it seems analoguous to the case where=20
there's no device in the first place.

Perhaps it would be better to return -ENOTTY from pci_dev_wait() and check=
=20
for that disconnected condition inside=20
pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus()? To further complicate things,=20
however, DPC also depends on the return value of=20
pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() and from its perspective, returning=20
error when there is a device that is disconnected might be the desirable=20
alternative (but I'm not fully sure how everything in DPC works but I=20
highly suspect I'm correct here).

Either way, the fix itself does care and seemed to work regardless of the=
=20
actual value returned by pci_dev_wait().

Sure, I'll add a comment there.

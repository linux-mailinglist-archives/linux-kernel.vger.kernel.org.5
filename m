It just occurred to me there is something very fishy about all of this.

What userspace do you have using kexec (not kexec on panic) that doesn't
preform the same userspace shutdown as a normal reboot?

Quite frankly such a userspace is buggy, and arguably that is where you
should start fixing things.  That way you can get the orderly shutdown
of userspace daemons/services along with an orderly shutdown of
everything the kernel is responsible for.

At the kernel level a kexec reboot and a normal reboot have been
deliberately kept as close as possible.  Which is why I say we should
fix it in reboot.

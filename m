I compared 'tps65224.h' with 'tps6594.h', especially register mapping.
There are less resources in TPS65224, but I don't see any incompatibility
between both PMIC register mappings. Some registers are not used by
your TPS65224, and some interrupts are not used either (that's not a
problem, they will not trigger, so). Beyond that, I2C and PFSM drivers
perform the same things for both PMICs. That's why according to me,
nothing prevents from re-using TPS6594 drivers. Even for ADC, which is
specific to your TPS65224 indeed, the register range does not overlap
with any of TPS6594 registers. You could conditionally add this driver
(that's what we did inÂ  'tps6594-core.c' for RTC driver, which is not used
for one of the compatibles: you can do something similar for ADC).
You will probably add support for others TPS65224 drivers over the next
weeks: SPI, ESM, RTC, GPIOs, regulators, watchdog, and ADC. Most of them
should be compatible with both TPS6594 and TPS65224, I think (even
watchdog driver, which was not developed for TPS6594). ADC will not,
but as explained above you can easily deal with this one thanks to
the compatible.
For 'tps65224-core.c' only, a little bit of work might be necessary to
handle your TPS65224 specific functionalities. By using a different DT
compatible string, your driver can then select different options (or maybe
even different register ranges) for some features based on the compatible.
But except for 'tps65xx-core.c', there is "sufficient overlap" to justify
sharing as much as possible between TPS65224 and TPS6594, in my
opinion.

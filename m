 From what I see:
In v1 kristen included a "From" tsg for Sean. In v2 she split the original  
patch into two and added some wrappers/ At that time, she removed the  
"From" tag for both patches but kept the SOB and CC.

@Kristen, could you confirm?

I only removed the wrappers from v2 based on Dave's comments.
So if confirmed by Kristen, should we add "From" tag for Sean?

I'll double check the other patches.
Thanks
Haitao

yes, I saw that, but wasn't it easier to do something like this:

	if (irq_status & ASPEED_I2CD_INTR_TX_NAK &&
	    bus->slave_state == ASPEED_I2C_SLAVE_READ_PROCESSED) {
		irq_handled |= ASPEED_I2CD_INTR_TX_NAK;
		bus->slave_state = ASPEED_I2C_SLAVE_STOP;

		if (irq_status & ASPEED_I2CD_INTR_SLAVE_MATCH)
			i2c_slave_event(slave, I2C_SLAVE_STOP, &value);

	}

But I see that Andrew has done some similar comment, also for
patch 2. You can answer both in the same mail, not to duplicate
the answer :-)

We can wait for him to reply.

Andi

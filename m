I still think helper is useful, but my previous thinking is problematic. 
I shouldn't
make fex_end() adapt to ext4_mb_new_inode_pa(), but should make
ext4_mb_new_inode_pa() adapt to fex_end(). After dropping the third argument
of fex_end(), modify the ext4_mb_new_inode_pa() function as follows:

This problem is found in the internal test.

Thank you for your review!

I don't actually want to impose this model on anyone, but this is the one that
could use some refactoring. I intend to rework these patches to not use a single
"td_partitioning_active" for decisions.

Let's differentiate between fast and slow I/O. The whole point of the paravisor in
L1 is to provide device emulation for slow I/O: TPM, RTC, NVRAM, IO-APIC, serial ports.

But fast I/O is designed to bypass it and go straight to L0. Hyper-V uses paravirtual
vmbus devices for fast I/O (net/block). The vmbus protocol has awareness of page visibility
built-in and uses native (GHCI on TDX, GHCB on SNP) mechanisms for notifications. So once
everything is set up (rings/buffers in swiotlb), the I/O for fast devices does not
involve L1. This is only possible when the VM manages C-bit itself.

I think the same thing could work for virtio if someone would "enlighten" vring
notification calls (instead of I/O or MMIO instructions).

Your description is correct, except that L2 uses a hypercall (hv_mark_gpa_visibility())
to notify L1 and L1 issues the MAP_GPA TDVMCALL to L0.

C-bit awareness is necessary to setup the whole swiotlb pool to be host visible for
DMA.

Presumably unmodified L2 and enlightened L2 are already covered by current code but
require excessive trapping to L1.

I can't see a usecase for TDVMCALLs but no "encryption bit".

That's how it currently works - all the enlightenments are in hypervisor/paravisor
specific code in arch/x86/hyperv and drivers/hv and the vm is not marked with
X86_FEATURE_TDX_GUEST.

But without X86_FEATURE_TDX_GUEST userspace has no unified way to discover that an
environment is protected by TDX and also the VM gets classified as "AMD SEV" in dmesg.
This is due to CC_ATTR_GUEST_MEM_ENCRYPT being set but X86_FEATURE_TDX_GUEST not.

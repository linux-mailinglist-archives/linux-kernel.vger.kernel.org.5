+1, I have the same opinion.

As you can expect, the above matches my understanding too.

OK and I assume this aligns with the below excerpts from the spec about
FFA_NOTIFICATION_INFO_GET:
"
This ABI is invoked by a VM at the Non-secure virtual FF-A instance with the
SMC or HVC conduits to request the Hypervisor to return the list of SPs and
VMs that have pending notifications. The Hypervisor returns the list of those
endpoints whose schedulers are implemented in the calling VM.
"

But if OPTEE driver in the VM/guest is the scheduler for the OPTEE SP,
then I would expect the FF-A driver to just register for SRI. It can't be
NPI as that contradicts with above.

At least so far we haven't found a strong reason to have different versions
for each.

OK, thanks for the setup info.

Understood.

But I still don't understand the mixup of SRI and NPI in your usecase
model. It should be just SRI. NPI handler must just use NOTIFICATION_GET
and not INFO_GET as Lorenzo has explained above.

Ok. Thank you very much for clarification. From that perspective
indeed it would be better to move the ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus() method
invocation to the host_init() callback.

Siddharth, if it won't be that much bother and you have an access to
the v3.65-based Keystone PCIe device, could you please have a look
whether it's possible to implement what Bjorn suggested? *

* it's irrespective to this patch. This fix looks good. If Bjorn
and/or Mani are ok with it, I guess it can be already merged in.

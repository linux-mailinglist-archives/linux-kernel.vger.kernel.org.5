If he, as the copyright owner, wants to take the code and do anything
else with it, under any other license, they can.  There's nothing
preventing them from doing that, a dual license is not needed (as long
as you don't take any changes that anyone else made under a different
license.)

Which is one of the main reasons dual license isn't really needed, if
the author wants the code to go somewhere else also, they are free to do
so as they own the copyright.

So please think carefully about mixing licenses like this, it's almost
never needed, and keeping the files with multiple licenses is a major
pain to handle over time.

good luck!

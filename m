Cgroup would refuse to allocate more when limit is reached so VMs can not  
run above limit.

IIRC VMs only support static EPC size right now, reaching limit at launch  
means the EPC size given in command line for QEMU is not appropriate. So  
VM should not launch, hence the current behavior.

[all EPC pages in guest are allocated on page fault caused by the  
sensitization process in guest kernel during init, which is part of the VM  
Launch process. So SIGNBUS will turn into failed VM launch.]

Once it is launched, guest kernel would have 'total capacity' given by the  
static value from QEMU option. And it would start paging when it is used  
up, never would ask for more from host.

For future with dynamic EPC for running guests, QEMU could handle  
allocation failure and pass SIGBUS to the running guest kernel.  Is that  
correct understanding?

If my understanding above is correct and understanding your statement  
above correctly, then don't see we really need separate knob for vEPC  
code. Reaching a cgroup limit by a running guest (assuming dynamic  
allocation implemented) should not translate automatically killing the VM.  
Instead, it's user space job to work with guest to handle allocation  
failure. Guest could page and kill enclaves.

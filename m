Based on your response it seem you do understand the problem but are
struggling to find a solution. You are ahead of me. I'm still at the
stage where I don't understand the problem. I had another look at
that orphanage code, especially at ccw_device_move_to_sch(). Looks
to me that the *(sch->lock) ins not required outlive the *sch and
also that there is no move semantic in place.

Based on that let's take this offline, find a quiet hour and have a look 
at the code and the problem. Maybe I can help with the solution once I
understand the problem -- but maybe not.

Regards,
Halil

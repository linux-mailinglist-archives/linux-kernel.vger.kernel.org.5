No, it is completely disjoint. In fact, the kernel doesn't even have
to be signed at all, but it still _must_ have a .sbat section when it
is used in a UKI. The UKI build tool (which is not a signing tool)
will merge the .sbat sections from the various PEs that it assemble,
currently kernel and stub, to create the final 'outer' .sbat in the
UKI PE. It's not expected for the kernel PE binary that gets merged in
the UKI to be signed. It is expected that it has a valid .sbat
section.

No, as mentioned above, the kernel doesn't even have to be signed. It
needs to carry .sbat data though, if it will be part of a signed UKI
that is loaded via the 3rd party CA flow.

That's not any different than grub.

From: "Steven Rostedt (Google)" <rostedt@goodmis.org>

The ring buffer timestamps are synchronized by two timestamp placeholders.
One is the "before_stamp" and the other is the "write_stamp" (sometimes
referred to as the "after stamp" but only in the comments. These two
stamps are key to knowing how to handle nested events coming in with a
lockless system.

When moving across sub-buffers, the before stamp is updated but the write
stamp is not. There's an effort to put back the before stamp to something
that seems logical in case there's nested events. But as the current event
is about to cross sub-buffers, and so will any new nested event that happens,
updating the before stamp is useless, and could even introduce new race
conditions.

The first event on a sub-buffer simply uses the sub-buffer's timestamp
and keeps a "delta" of zero. The "before_stamp" and "write_stamp" are not
used in the algorithm in this case. There's no reason to try to fix the
before_stamp when this happens.

As a bonus, it removes a cmpxchg() when crossing sub-buffers!

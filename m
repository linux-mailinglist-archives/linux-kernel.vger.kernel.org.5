I think so.  07e292950b93 ("PCI: Allow root and child buses to have
different pci_ops") says:

  PCI host bridges often have different ways to access the root and child
  bus config spaces. The host bridge drivers have invented their own
  abstractions to handle this. Let's support having different root and
  child bus pci_ops so these per driver abstractions can be removed.

Probably so.

But I don't think this code should be in an .add_bus() method in the
first place.  Ideally I think the content of ks_pcie_v3_65_add_bus()
would move to the ks_pcie_host_init() path so we wouldn't need the
.add_bus() hook at all.

I think it was added as ks_dw_pcie_v3_65_scan_bus() by 0c4ffcfe1fbc
("PCI: keystone: Add TI Keystone PCIe driver"), which doesn't explain
why doing this after scanning the secondary bus is needed.

The .scan_bus() hook was added by b14a3d1784a9 ("PCI: designware: Add
support for v3.65 hardware"), which says:

  3. MSI interrupt generation requires EP to write to the RC's
     application register.  So enhance the driver to allow setup of
     inbound access to MSI IRQ register as a post scan bus API callback.

That's not a convincing argument for why the BAR setup has to be done
*after* enumerating the endpoints, but presumably there was some
reason.

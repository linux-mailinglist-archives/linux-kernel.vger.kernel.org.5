Thanks and sorry, I just realised now that this is the stress-ng uprobe and
not the netperf regression. So hopefully that shouldn't be much trouble
reproducing on my end. I will give that a try.

Since we have a performance regression that is or may be related to cpuidle
the first thing I would like to know is if the governor is doing a good
job from a cpuidle perspective (and the regression is caused by the latency
of waking up from the deeper idle states that were a correct decision) or
if you can already see issues just from a cpuidle perspective.
Anyway I'll take a look and report back!

Christian

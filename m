Yeah, probably the OS part should be dropped.

Sure, but we shouldn't change things just to be different from
downstream. If we're only discussing the color of the shed, then no
point changing it.

FWIW, gregkh pretty much always nacks new module parameters.

You've already got my reviewed-by. If you aren't happy with this, then
fine. I don't know enough about L1SS to comment further. Is it
normally always supported or discoverable? If so, then I'd think we'd
want it default enabled with a disable override flag. Maybe it should
be generic?

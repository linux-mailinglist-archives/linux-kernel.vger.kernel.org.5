So, the assumptions in the original design were:

* Writers are high freq but readers are lower freq and can block.

* The global lock is mutex.

* Back-to-back reads won't have too much to do because it only has to flush
  what's been accumulated since the last flush which took place just before.

It's likely that the userspace side is gonna be just fine if we restore the
global lock to be a mutex and let them be. Most of the problems are caused
by trying to allow flushing from non-sleepable and kernel contexts. Would it
make sense to distinguish what can and can't wait and make the latter group
always use cached value? e.g. even in kernel, during oom kill, waiting
doesn't really matter and it can just wait to obtain the up-to-date numbers.

Thanks.

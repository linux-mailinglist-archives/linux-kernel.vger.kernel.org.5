Hi Jan

I think I found the thread that is holding the transaction handle. It 
seems to be in runnable state though.
It has the journal_info set to the journal handle that has the matching 
transaction as the journal's running transaction.
Here is the associated stack trace. It is converting unwritten extents 
to extents.

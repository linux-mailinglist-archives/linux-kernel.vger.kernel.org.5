Yeah, the ":k" within the slashes isn't right, and I suspect that's due to the
way the event gets expanded.

Ian, is that something you're aware of already?

I'm not aware of a thread for the way filters get applied to expanded events.

I'll try to look into this a bit more.

I'm ok in principle with exposing some info on the supported exclude_*
configuration, but it's worth noting that event where a PMU supports specific
filters, it might not support all combinations of filters for all events. For
example, s390 doesn't support exclude_* filters on RAW events, and doesn't
support kernel-only counters. Given that, I'm not sure how we can expose that
in a useful way.

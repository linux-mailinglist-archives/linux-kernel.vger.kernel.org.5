What I would like to know is which API systemd is attempting to use,
and which -apparently- may never become available if no TPM is exposed
by the kernel.

Ideally, we should be able to take inspiration from the probe deferral
work, and return -EAGAIN to convey that it is too early to signal
either success or permanent failure.

Exposing random firmware assets directly to user space to make guesses
about this doesn't seem like a very robust approach to this issue.

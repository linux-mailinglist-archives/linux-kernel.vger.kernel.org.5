I did that in v2 because then the two patches had to be split to
facilitate backporting as wcn3991 support was added later.

But the big issue here is taking the patches through different trees. If
Bjorn could ack the DT patch so that everything goes through the
Bluetooth tree, then I guess I can reorder the DT patch and squash the
two driver patches.

But waiting several weeks just to make sure that the DT patch hits
mainline (and the binding patch before that?) before the driver fixes
can go in just does not seem worth it to me.

Of course, understood.

Got some piece of code creating an interrupt controller at PCI device level.
To have it working, '#interrupt-cell = <1>' and 'interrupt-controller'
properties need to be set in the PCI device DT node.

I can set them when the PCI device DT node is created (add them in
of_pci_add_properties()) but as this interrupt controller is specific to the
PCI device driver (it needs to be created after the pci_enable_device() call
and will probably be device specific with MSI), it would make sense to have
these properties set by the PCI device driver itself or in the overlay it
applies.

But these properties creation done by the device driver itself (or the
overlay) lead to memory leaks.
Indeed, we cannot add properties to an existing node without memory
leaks. When a property is removed, the property is not freed but moved
to the node->deadprops list (of_remove_property()).
The properties present in the list will be free once the node itself is
removed.
In our use-case, the node (PCI device node) is not removed when the driver
is removed and probe again (rmmod/insmod).

Do you have any opinion about the '#interrupt-cell' and
'interrupt-controller' properties creation:

- Created by of_pci_add_properties():
  No mem leak but done outside the specific device driver itself and done for
  all PCI devices.
  Maybe the driver will not create the interrupt controller, maybe it will
  prefer an other value for '#interrupt-cell', maybe it will handle MSI and
  will need to set other properties, ... All of these are device specific.

- Created by the device driver itself (or the overlay it applies):
  The mem leak is present. Any idea about a way to fix that or at least having
  a fix for some properties ?
  I was thinking about avoiding to export properties (of_find_property()) and
  so avoid references properties or introducing refcount on properties but
  these modifications touch a lot of drivers and subsystems and are subject
  to errors.
  That's said, checking a property presence based on its name can be done without
  exporting the property, as well as getting a single value. Iterating over array
  values need some more complicated code.

Syscalls are explicitly exposed to user space, thus, even if it is used
ONLY for a very specific situation, it is an official kernel interface,
and need to care about the compatibility. (If it causes SIGILL unless
a specific use case, I don't know there is a "compatibility".)
And the number of syscalls are limited resource.

I'm actually not sure how much we need to care of it, but adding a new
syscall is worth to be discussed carefully because all of them are
user-space compatibility.

I doubt that the interrupt (exception) and syscall should be handled
differently. Especially, this exception is injected by uprobes but
syscall will be caused by itself. But syscall can be called from user
program (of couse this works as sys_kill(self, SIGILL)).

OK, we at least need to document it.

Of course user expected that it is abusing. So at least we need to
add a document that this syscall number is reserved to uprobes and
user program must not use it.

I think at least it should check the caller address to ensure the
address is in the trampoline.
But anyway, uprobes itself can break the target process, so no one
might care if this system call breaks the process now.

Is that OK to use a syscall as "internal" and "unstable" API?

([OT] If we can add syscall so casually, I would like to add sys_traceevent
for recording user space events :-) .)

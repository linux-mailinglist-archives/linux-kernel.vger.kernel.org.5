A module_param sounds possible to me.  IIRC the bidirectional CLKREQ#
(config (c)) has been tested and there are no known problems even if
the OS doesn't enable L1SS.  The only issue (again, IIRC) is that the
hardware engineer has unspecified reservations about it.

Is there any room to make (c) the default and have a module_param to
*disable* the L1SS support?  I think the driver knows enough to then
select (a) or (b) by itself.

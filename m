Thanks for this patch.  We're in the v6.7 merge window, so we won't
start merging v6.8 content until v6.7-rc1 (probably Nov 12).

As far as I know, there's no requirement for firmware to set MRRS at
all *except* for the "no_inc_mrrs" hack added by 8b3517f88ff2.  That
hack treats the current MRRS value as a limit to work around the
Loongson bug that read requests larger than the limit cause a
Completer Abort instead of multiple completions.

s/inavlid/invalid/

This part isn't clear to me, though.  What exactly does "device got
disabled" mean?  The device got reset?  Power cycled?
PCI_COMMAND_MASTER was cleared?

PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE quirks are run during pci_enable_device(), which
basically just turns on PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY and/or PCI_COMMAND_IO.

If MRRS gets reset when PCI_COMMAND_MASTER is set or cleared, we don't
have a quirk phase that runs during pci_set_master(), which is where
PCI_COMMAND_MASTER gets set, so it's not clear that
pci_enable_device() is the right place.

We'll look for an ack from the maintainer.  Maybe that's you, since
you added the driver in the first place?  Or maybe it's Huacai?

MAINTAINERS currently doesn't list anybody for
drivers/pci/controller/pci-loongson.c, and it should.  That should be
a separate patch.

This looks like the same list of devices as for loongson_mrrs_quirk().
So I guess the idea is that we need loongson_mrrs_quirk() for
Loongarch-based systems, and this loongson_old_mrrs_quirk() for
MIPS-based systems?

If so, maybe they could be #ifdef'd to show that, e.g., so that only
one or the other is compiled?

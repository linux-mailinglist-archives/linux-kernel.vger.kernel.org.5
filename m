Ah, you did a manual lookup?
Because get_maintainer.pl seems to do the right thing:

$ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl drivers/mtd/devices/block2mtd.c
Joern Engel <joern@lazybastard.org> (maintainer:BLOCK2MTD DRIVER)
Miquel Raynal <miquel.raynal@bootlin.com> (maintainer:MEMORY TECHNOLOGY DEVICES (MTD))
Richard Weinberger <richard@nod.at> (maintainer:MEMORY TECHNOLOGY DEVICES (MTD))
Vignesh Raghavendra <vigneshr@ti.com> (maintainer:MEMORY TECHNOLOGY DEVICES (MTD))
linux-mtd@lists.infradead.org (open list:BLOCK2MTD DRIVER)
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org (open list)

Yep, let's try this route. :-)

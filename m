Thank you very much, Ted. That's what I was asking. I don't see the
point in bothering to send the second version (which I've never done) if
there's someone who knows how to do it and is willing to help. I tried
it by myself and searching the internet and I didn't find the right way.

Thanks for your time, Ted.

I really apreciate your help.

Ok, if you don't think it's necessary, I won't send the v2.

Yesterday I realized that I made a *BIG* mistake: I sent the email to the
wrong list. I wanted to send the email to the list linux-kernel-mentees
because I think it is the right place to ask these questions and not
bother the kernel developers, but no harm comes from good. In this way
Markus has told me tasks that I can do to start help the community.

Thanks Markus!

Sorry for sending the message several times with the subject: "I know
you are busy, but have you found time to look at my patch?" to the
linux-ext4 mailing list, but the first time I sent it from web site
https://mail.google.com and I got this response: "Content-Policy reject
msg: The message contains HTML subpart, therefore we consider it SPAM or
Outlook Virus. TEXT/PLAIN is accepted.!", so I tried to send the message
with other mail clients and I didn't see the message in
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ext4/maillist.html looking for
megia.oscar or Oscar Megia L=C3=B3pez, so I tried several times believing
that you did not receive it. On Friday I realized that you did receive
it. I have seen it in https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ext4/?q=3Dmegia.oscar

I apologize for repeatedly sending that email inadvertently. It was not
my intention.

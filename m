This leaves me even less sure what you're even talking about here. Are we
talking about aspm_attr_store_common() which "enables" states by changing 
link->aspm_disable? (But aspm_attr_store_common() just as much "disables" 
states by altering link->aspm_disable so I don't see how there's 
difference between enabled/disabled ones).

During pcie_aspm_pm_state_change(), pcie_config_aspm_link() then uses 
link->aspm_capable and link->aspm_disable as input but it won't change 
link->aspm_disable (= it won't overwrite the user's input).

pcie_update_aspm_capable() done before calling pcie_config_aspm_path() can 
alter link->aspm_capable (looks very much intentional) which can lead into 
some state not being available any more for pcie_config_aspm_link().
Is this what you are trying to say, that some state gets removed from 
link->aspm_capable and the effective result is that a state user enabled
via sysfs can no longer be enabled?

I even looked into aspm.c from 08d0cc5f3426 but cannot see significant 
differences on how link->aspm_disable is being handled vs current code.

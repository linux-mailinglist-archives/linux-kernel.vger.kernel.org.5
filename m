My concern is not only the VMM, but any userspace that perform
single-stepping. Imagine the debugger tracks PC by itself, and simply
increments it by 4 on a non-branch, non-fault instruction.

Move the vcpu or the userspace around, rewind PC, and now the debugger
is out of whack with what is executing. While I agree that there is
not much a hypervisor can do about that, I'm a bit worried that we are
going to break existing SW with this.

Now the obvious solution is "don't do that"...

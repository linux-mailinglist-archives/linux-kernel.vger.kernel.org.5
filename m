Maybe he has some ideas on this issue.

Did you up the loglevel to 8 to make sure you'll get all kernel output 
on the serial port, not just errors?

Rather than lspci, is it specifically config space access from sysfs? 
Does the output from the serial port change with IOMMU enabled vs disabled?

Can you check FCH::PM::S5_RESET_STATUS on next boot after failure has 
occurred?  It is available at MMIO FED80300 or through indirect IO 
access at 0xC0.

If MMIO doesn't work, double check FCH::PM_ISACONTROL bit 1 (described 
on page 296) to confirm if your system enables it.

The meanings of the different bits can be found in a recent PPR:
https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/processor-tech-docs/programmer-references/55901_B1_pub_053.zip

Indirect IO is described on PDF page 294.

This will at least give us a hint what's going on in this case.

I think this should read "default" mode, not "aspm" mode, since "aspm"
is not a mode implemented by this patch, right?

I think this refers to bug 217276, mentioned below?

This sounds scary.  If a NIC is put in L1.2, does this mean will we
see this CPU abort if there's no traffic for a long time?  What is
needed to avoid the CPU abort?

What does this mean for users?  L1SS is designed for long periods of
the device being idle, so this leaves me feeling that using L1SS is
unsafe in general.  Hopefully this impression is unwarranted, and all
we need is some clarification here.

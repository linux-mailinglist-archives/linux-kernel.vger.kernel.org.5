 I see what you mean, and I now remember the note in the spec.  I had 
concerns about it, but did not do anything about it at that point.

 I think we still have no guarantee that LT will be clear at the point we 
set RL, because LT could get reasserted by hardware between our read and 
the setting of RL.  IIUC that doesn't matter really, because the new link 
parameters will be taken into account regardless of whether retraining was
initiated by hardware in an attempt to do link recovery or triggered by 
software via RL.

 Correct.

 I think it just confirms what I observed above (and which is surely noted 
somewhere in the spec) that modified link parameters are taken into 
account regardless of how retraining has been initiated and the link gets 
established (at 2.5GT/s) at the first call to `pcie_wait_for_link_status' 
already and returns successfully seeing DLLLA set.

 I think I now understand the problem correctly, and indeed from master 
Linux repo's point of view it's been a defect with the merge referred.  
So I withdraw my objection.  Sorry about the confusion.

 However I think the last paragraph of your commit description:

> Since waiting for Data Link Layer Link Active bit is only used for the
> Target Speed quirk, this only impacts the case when the quirk attempts
> to restore speed to higher than 2.5 GT/s (The link is Up at that point

is not accurate enough, which contributed to my confusion.  In particular 
`pcie_retrain_link' succeeds when the link is up, because it calls 
`pcie_wait_for_link_status' such as to succeed when either LT is clear or 
DLLLA is set.  How about:

This only impacts the Target Speed quirk, which is the only case where 
waiting for Data Link Layer Link Active bit is used.  It currently works 
in the problematic case by means of link training getting initiated by 
hardware repeatedly and respecting the new link parameters set by the 
caller, which then make training succeed and bring the link up, setting 
DLLLA and causing pcie_wait_for_link_status() to return success.  We are 
not supposed to rely on luck and need to make sure that LT transitioned
through the inactive state though before we initiate link training by 
hand via RL.

then?

 Also for `pcie_retrain_link' I think it would be clearer if we rephrased 
the note as follows:

	 * Ensure the updated LNKCTL parameters are used during link
	 * training by checking that there is no ongoing link training
	 * that may have started before link parameters were changed, so
	 * as to avoid LTSSM race as recommended in Implementation Note
	 * at the end of PCIe r6.0.1 sec 7.5.3.7.

 NB I am currently away on holiday until the end of next week.  However I 
do have access to my lab and I'll see if I can verify your change tonight
or another evening this week, and overall thank you for your patience.

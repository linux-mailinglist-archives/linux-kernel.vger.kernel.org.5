 From what I understand, using only one table with a size that is a power of two
won't let us use the entire MMIO space, hence the only solution to allow using
the entire range is to split to more than one table.

I'm not sure, though, whether PCIe devices would be able to use a MEM space that
is not power of two, or if those do even exist.

If there are devices that can use 32MB < mem <= 62MB, then I completely agree
with Jianjun on this commit.... so please, can any PCI(/e) maintainer comment
on this situation?

Regards,
Angelo

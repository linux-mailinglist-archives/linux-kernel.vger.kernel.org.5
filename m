Fair points, the intent from the conversation with Darrick was the
addition of support for FALLOC_FL_UNSHARE_RANGE in patch 2 of v4
(originally suggested by Brian Forster in [1]): if we allow
fallocate(UNSHARE_RANGE) on a loop device (ex. for creating a
snapshot, similar in nature to the FICLONE example you mentioned on
the loop patch), we'd (ideally) want to pass it through to the
underlying layers and let them figure out what to do with it. But it
is only for situations where we are explicitly know what the
underlying layers are and what's the mecha

I agree though that it clouds the API a bit and I don't think it
necessarily needs to be a part of the initial patch series: for now, I
propose keeping just mode zero (and FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE) handling in
the block series patch and drop this patch for now. WDYT?

Best
Sarthak

Not exactly, simply relying on the hit/intercept metrics while
functional still just amounts to pretty much guessing as it does not
take any information about what the cpu might be doing into account
(beyond the timer events but that's the case for both approaches).

Apart from the approach of "extrapolating future results from past
mistakes" being slightly questionable to begin with it's in my view made
even worse by the fact that the metrics are per cpu - meaning they get
essentially invalidated when tasks get migrated between cores.

Using just the hit/intercept metrics approach you end up bumping into
the two scenarios below:

1) workload with short idle times -> governor selects too deep states
then adjusts to shallower idle -> -> workload changes to longer idle times
-> governor selects too shallow then adjusts to deeper -> workload changes to
shorter idle -> governor keeps selecting too deep states before adjusting

From looking at many traces I had this happens pretty often and we end
up with the governor selecting deep idle while the avg util on the cpu
is still massive and by looking at the util we could clearly tell that
deep idle here would be a mistake. The metrics cannot avoid making that
mistake, they need to make several of them in order to adjust. You can
just get stuck ping-ponging between being wrong both ways.

2) A reasonably large task gets migrated onto a different CPU. The
metrics on the target CPU still favour deeper idle as it wasn't doing
anything up until the migration, the metrics on the previous CPU favour
shallower states because of the workload having just run there. Now you
have the target CPU selecing too deep states before it can adjust and
the previous one selecting too shallow.

With the util approach on the other hand, the change in util will be
reflected right away so we can avoid making said mistakes on both the
cores.

There might be a platform difference here, I do think it probably makes
more sense on Arm and similar platforms where we only have 2 states to
choose from so you use the threshold to distinguish between 'deep idle
desirable' and 'deep idle not desirable'. It does feel slighly more
hacky on Intel and other platforms with however many states those have
as instead of "change scenario A to B" it ends up more like "lower
scenario A". Doesn't make it a bad idea though, it can still be
beneficial and bring improvements just like on Arm I think. My initial
suggestion was to make this a separate governor for platforms and use
cases where this makes sense.

Besides, the threshold isn't random - just empirically the level that
worked best for the approach. As I wrote in the other thread, it might
benefit from being tweaked depending on the platform. That's not unique
to this patchset in any case, the kernel is full of these arbitrary
numbers that come from "worked on the developer's machine" and not much
else after all.

I put the numbers from testing this in the original thread for the
patchset, the util approach was consistently getting much less too deep
sleeps than the metrics approach in all the workloads I tested to the
point of being noticeable on both the performance and power usage plots
for our use cases (Android mobile phone). I never advocated for this to
be made the default but it is useful for our side of the industry so at
the very least we should have this as an option. In my view given that
x86 and arm do cpuidle very differently we probably should have separate
governors instead of trying to make a one size fits all approach but
that's a different story.

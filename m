I can try to rephrase this a bit:
' Provide a new power value for the device at the given frequency. This
allows to reflect changed power profile in runtime.'

That sounds better indeed.

We just call the entry in EM the 'performance state' (so frequency and
power). I will rephrase this as well:
'Frequency of the @dev expressed in kHz'

OK, it can be re-written as:
'Power value of the @dev at the given @freq (modified)'

The driver or kernel module, which is aware about thermal events. Those
events might be coming from FW to kernel, but we need to maintain
the same 'context' for all OPPs when we start the EM update.

This 'priv' field is used for passing the 'context' back to the
caller, so the caller can consistently the update. The update might
be with some math formula which multiplies the power by some factor
value (based on thermal model and current temperature).

I will change that and add the '@dev' word to make this more precised.


'update_power() is used by runtime modifiable EM. It aims to update the
@dev EM power values for all registered frequencies.'

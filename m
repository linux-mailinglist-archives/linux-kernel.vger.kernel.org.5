If the permissions are changed, then mprotect() must have called the pgtable
helpers to modify the page table (e.g. ptep_set_wrprotect(),
ptep_set_access_flags() or whatever). These functions will notice that the
contpte block is currently folded and unfold it before apply the permissions
change. The unfolding process is done in a way that intentionally avoids
misprogramming as defined by the Arm ARM. See contpte_fold() in contpte.c.

I've taken a closer look at memcg_vmstats_needs_flush(). And I'm
concerned about overhead maintaining the stats (that is used as a filter).

   static bool memcg_vmstats_needs_flush(struct memcg_vmstats *vmstats)
   {
	return atomic64_read(&vmstats->stats_updates) >
		MEMCG_CHARGE_BATCH * num_online_cpus();
   }

I looked at `vmstats->stats_updates` to see how often this is getting 
updated.  It is updated in memcg_rstat_updated(), but it gets inlined 
into a number function (__mod_memcg_state, __mod_memcg_lruvec_state, 
__count_memcg_events), plus it calls cgroup_rstat_updated().
Counting invocations per sec (via funccount):

   10:28:09
   FUNC                                    COUNT
   __mod_memcg_state                      377553
   __count_memcg_events                   393078
   __mod_memcg_lruvec_state              1229673
   cgroup_rstat_updated                  2632389


I'm surprised to see how many time per sec this is getting invoked.
Originating from memcg_rstat_updated() = 2,000,304 times per sec.
(On a 128 CPU core machine with 39% idle CPU-load.)
Maintaining these stats seems excessive...

Then how often does the filter lower pressure on lock:

   MEMCG_CHARGE_BATCH(64) * 128 CPU = 8192
   2000304/(64*128) = 244 time per sec (every ~4ms)
   (assuming memcg_rstat_updated val=1)

I'm also not-a-fan of having two layer of time-based rate-limiting, but 
they do operate a different time scales *and* are not active at the same 
time with current patch, if you noticed the details, then I excluded 
memcg from using this as I commented "memcg have own ratelimit layer" 
(in do_flush_stats).

I would prefer removing the memcg time rate-limiting and use this more 
granular 50ms (20 timer/sec) for memcg also.  And I was planning to do 
that in a followup patchset.  The 50ms (20 timer/sec) limit will be per 
cgroup in the system, which then "scales"/increase with the number of 
cgroups, but better than unbounded read/access locks per sec.

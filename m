Right, that's possible if the boot firmware has support for a connection
manager. Although we do reset the whole topology with the USB4 v2 host
routers this is kept as is for v1.

Note it currently is setting the link between xHCI and the
USB4/Thunderbolt host controller but we may want to change it later to
link between USB 3.x port and the USB4/Thunderbolt host to allow more
fine grained power management, this is especially true with the new USB
Gen T tunneling. So for now it is only PCI but we may need to touch the
USB stack too (perhaps put it in drivers/acpi/ instead).

I'm not sure it makes sense to explain from the zero all this stuff that
people can easily look up from the corresponding spec, such as PCIe or
USB.

There is a good picture in USB4 v2 ch 2.2.3 about paths crossing USB4
fabric, perhaps reference that one? Or ch 2.2.10.3 that shows how this
works with PCIe tunneling instead (although they are similar).

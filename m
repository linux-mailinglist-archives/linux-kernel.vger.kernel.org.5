I don't see this as an important goal either.

I've been experimenting with running EFI apps inside kernel space instead.
This is the more natural approach for signed images. Sure, a malicious EFI
app could do arbitrary stuff in kernel mode, but they're signed. On the other
hand running this entirely in user space would at least guarantee that the
system can not crash due to a misbehaving EFI app (at least until
ExitBootServices()).

The question of whether or not to make this the job of a userspace helper that
is signed must have come up when kexec_file_load syscall was added. It would
have also been an option at the time to extend trust to a signed version of
the userspace kexec tool.

Why was kexec_file_load created instead of restricting kexec_load to a signed
version of the kexec userspace tool?

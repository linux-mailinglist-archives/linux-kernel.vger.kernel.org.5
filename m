I did in my prior response. Here, I was just making it clear that 
something host controller specific is a non-starter as you did.

For config, we had some bindings that did this and we moved away from 
it. I don't remember the details. Unless it's ECAM region, I don't think 
using ranges makes any sense as how to use the region will still be host 
specific.

For TLP messages, do we have other hosts that could use ranges for them? 
Is there something in the PCIe spec that defines TLP as an address 
space and what that address space looks like? IIRC, some hosts (Altera?) 
just have a message sending interface and that includes config space 
accesses.

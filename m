Sorry, I don't know or remember all the history behind this, so can't
give any useful hints.  If the devm functions are mostly wrappers
without interesting content, it might make sense to collect them
together.  If they *do* have interesting content, it probably makes
sense to put them next to their non-devm counterparts.

The pci_request_region() managed/unmanaged thing does seem like it
could be unexpected and lead to issues as you point out.

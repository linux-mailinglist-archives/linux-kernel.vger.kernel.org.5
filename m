From a user's point of view disabling a device is often worse than a
reboot. If you get a fatal error from a system's only network card
then disabling the card may result in the system being uncontactable
until someone manually recovers it. Similarly, if the disk hosting the
root filesystem disappears the system may not crash immediately (most
of what it needs will be in page cache), but there's no guarantee that
it can do anything useful in that state. In both cases forcing a
reboot will probably bring the system back into a usable state.

The PCIe spec is (intentionally?) vague about the causes of fatal
errors. For all we know a device is reporting one because the embedded
OS it was running crashed and as a side effect it's been DMAing junk
into system memory for the past hour. If you know something about the
device in question maybe you can make those assumptions, but in
general it's impossible to assess the actual severity of an error.
Even in the case of a noisy link causing bit flips (it's possible,
LCRC is only 16bit and ECEC is optional) if we get corruption of the
address bits of the TLP header then the DMA might have overwritten
something important to the OS. From a hardware vendor's point of view
just forcing a reboot makes a lot of sense.

Paranoia aside, in a lot of cases PCI device errors are nothing major
and can be resolved by just restarting the device. However, there's no
way for generic kernel code to make that assessment and we probably
shouldn't have the kernel guess. I'd say the safest option would be to
punt that decision to userspace and provide some way to whitelist
devices that we can ignore errors from. I'm not familiar enough with
the ACPI to know if we have enough details in the notification it
sends to actually implement that though.

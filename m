Have you contacted the Chrome kernel folks about this? Perhaps they
have thought about this already?

Yes, you are missing the 1. that it needs to be directly behind the PCIe
root or downstream port that is marked as ->external_facing, and the
fact that there can't be NHI's (that's the host controller with the IDs
I listed in 3.) anywhere else except starting the topology according the
USB4 spec (and the same applies to Thunderbolt 1-3).

We had an initial discussion about the performance QoS some weeks ago. 
Rafael is reluctant to have arbitrary values. So it was proposed a 1024 
based approach and let the back end to convert the value to its index.

If we go for a similar approach to the frequencies, then we should have 
more files to describe the different states. At least one defining the 
current state, the min and the max.

Yes, it is a valid point. May be we can find an intermediate approach.

If we define an additional information, let's call it "granularity" for 
example and keep the 0-1023, then the userspace can rely on this 
information to build the steps.

If we take your example with a 3 performance states device, then the 
granularity would be:

1024 / 3 = 341.3

As floating does not exist in the kernel, then it would be 342.

State 0 = 0 x 342 = 0
State 1 = 1 x 342 = 342
State 2 = 2 x 342 = 684
State 3 = 3 x 342 = 1026 (floored to 1024)

So we end up with a fixed range, a way to quickly escalate the stairs 
and three files in the device's power sysfs entry.

I think it is a different subject, we are talking about how to describe 
the hardware and these performance states. But I agree, it is worth to 
keep the opp description in mind.

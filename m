The logic of testing pci_dev_is_disconnected() in patch [2/3] works
in the opposite:

1. if pci_dev_is_disconnected() return true, means the device is in
    the process of surprise removal handling, adapter already been
    removed from the slot.

2. for removed device, no need to send ATS invalidation request to it.
    removed device lost power, its devTLB wouldn't be valid anymore.

3. if pci_dev_is_disconnected() return false, the device is *likely*
    to be removed at any momoment after this function called.
    such case will be treated in the iommu ITE fault handling, not to
    retry the timeout request if device isn't present (patch [3/3]).

even in the process while TLB is invalidating.

Yup, your concern is worthy ,but isn't happening within this patchset.

It doesn't try to close the race window, actually we are doing post-fault
handling in patch [3/3].

It is testing in customer's environment. separatly, patch[3/3] vs

patch [2/3].

will test patch[3/3] alone, if couldn't recover from the 100% ITE fault
case, we will look for other method.

I can answer this one in rather than waiting for Alastair to see it
(given I was involved in shooting down the earlier proposal :(

At least partly motivated by providing the info for lspci which
I agree with being a useful addition for debug etc.
https://github.com/pciutils/pciutils/pull/152

I can see it would also be useful for things that will poke from
userspace because they aren't expected to run in production (and hence
hopefully don't care about potential races etc). CXL compliance
comes to mind - I don't think we ever want to carry kernel code for that.

Hi,

I'm struggling to convince myself that free_swap_and_cache() can't race with
with swapoff(). Can anyone explain that this is safe?

I *think* they are both serialized by the PTL, since all callers of
free_swap_and_cache() (except shmem) have the PTL, and swapoff() calls
try_to_unuse() early on, which takes the PTL as it iterates over every vma in
every mm. It looks like shmem is handled specially by a call to shmem_unuse(),
but I can't see the exact serialization mechanism.

I've implemented a batching function, as David suggested above, but I'm trying
to convince myself that it is safe for it to access si->swap_map[] without a
lock (i.e. that swapoff() can't concurrently free it). But I think
free_swap_and_cache() as it already exists depends on being able to access the
si without an explicit lock, so I'm assuming the same mechanism will protect my
new changes. But I want to be sure I understand the mechanism...


This is the existing free_swap_and_cache(). I think _swap_info_get() would break
if this could race with swapoff(), and __swap_entry_free() looks up the cluster
from an array, which would also be freed by swapoff if racing:

int free_swap_and_cache(swp_entry_t entry)
{
	struct swap_info_struct *p;
	unsigned char count;

	if (non_swap_entry(entry))
		return 1;

	p = _swap_info_get(entry);
	if (p) {
		count = __swap_entry_free(p, entry);
		if (count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE)
			__try_to_reclaim_swap(p, swp_offset(entry),
					      TTRS_UNMAPPED | TTRS_FULL);
	}
	return p != NULL;
}


This is my new function. I want to be sure that it's safe to do the
READ_ONCE(si->swap_info[...]):

void free_swap_and_cache_nr(swp_entry_t entry, int nr)
{
	unsigned long end = swp_offset(entry) + nr;
	unsigned type = swp_type(entry);
	struct swap_info_struct *si;
	unsigned long offset;

	if (non_swap_entry(entry))
		return;

	si = _swap_info_get(entry);
	if (!si || end > si->max)
		return;

	/*
	 * First free all entries in the range.
	 */
	for (offset = swp_offset(entry); offset < end; offset++) {
		VM_WARN_ON(data_race(!si->swap_map[offset]));
		__swap_entry_free(si, swp_entry(type, offset));
	}

	/*
	 * Now go back over the range trying to reclaim the swap cache. This is
	 * more efficient for large folios because we will only try to reclaim
	 * the swap once per folio in the common case. If we do
	 * __swap_entry_free() and __try_to_reclaim_swap() in the same loop, the
	 * latter will get a reference and lock the folio for every individual
	 * page but will only succeed once the swap slot for every subpage is
	 * zero.
	 */
	for (offset = swp_offset(entry); offset < end; offset += nr) {
		nr = 1;
		if (READ_ONCE(si->swap_map[offset]) == SWAP_HAS_CACHE) { << HERE
			/*
			 * Folios are always naturally aligned in swap so
			 * advance forward to the next boundary. Zero means no
			 * folio was found for the swap entry, so advance by 1
			 * in this case. Negative value means folio was found
			 * but could not be reclaimed. Here we can still advance
			 * to the next boundary.
			 */
			nr = __try_to_reclaim_swap(si, offset,
					      TTRS_UNMAPPED | TTRS_FULL);
			if (nr == 0)
				nr = 1;
			else if (nr < 0)
				nr = -nr;
			nr = ALIGN(offset + 1, nr) - offset;
		}
	}
}

Thanks,
Ryan

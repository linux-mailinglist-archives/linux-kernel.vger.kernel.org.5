I, too, was somewhat worried about having LT never clear for long enough=20
to successfully sample it during the wait but it's like you say, any new=20
link training should take account the new Target Speed which should=20
successfully bring the link up (assuming the quirk works in the first=20
place) and that should clear LT.

Thanks, and the confusion was entirely my fault caused my confusing=20
and partly wrong wording.

I know, it was simply wrong because I somehow misthought which way those=20
use_lt negations worked (and thus thought I found a different problem=20
than there really was).

I already did major rewriting here to explain out how the code ended up=20
into its current shape but I'll also consider your explanation below=20
which is likely better than what I've currently, thanks.

Don't worry. I can easily wait even until you're back from the holiday
so no need to push it or anything. :-)

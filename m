So the STM32 chip is connected directly via USB. There is USB hub on 
Manta boards and Pi adapter (Not on BTT Pi. That one doesnt use USB hub)
that uses this USB port and STM32 connects via that. Then on manta 
boards there are 2 USB ports and 1 USB port with just pins exposed on
XH2.54 4 pin connector. Bit weird but it is what it is :)

It is indeed an alternative power supply. Or well primary supply in the 
case of Pi adapter board.

It should be connected yes. Tho i never really had much luck getting it 
to work. Tho i will check again and if i get it to work i will enable it 
in V2 :)

Correct. Its just pins that get the 5V power. My fault for saying 
directly from USB-C since it can be from somewhere else :)

This is my bad. This is completely wrong. The actual regulator is the 5V 
one thats turned on when 5V comes in. Its bit weird but i suppose its 
done that way for USB-OTG. This will be removed in next revision of this 
DTS :)

Its just straight up not connected. And since documentation specifies 
that this should be set when no card detection is available i set it.

Will add a comment specifying that this is due to the pin not being 
connected.

The range here should be correct. It is also the sys rail. Since AXP313a 
lacks many rails this was chosen as the sys rail as well.

That is indeed right. I will test it on the range you provided with OPP

it uses Kingston D2516ECMDXGJD so DDR3. I will specify the direct voltage.

ALDO1 1.8V gets also converted to 1.8V for DRAM. Thus needs to be on always.

Actually the SoM has exposed pads to connect UART (Which is what i have 
done to get UART) but also the boards get the exact pins wired to GPIO.

But since most users would use the GPIO UART i will specify it in 
carrier boards and in BTT Pi boards separately.

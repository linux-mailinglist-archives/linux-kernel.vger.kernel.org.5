I disagree with the reasoning behind "brcm,enable-l1ss" property usage
instead of a command line option - at least I would like to get a
comment from DT maintainers about it.

I think Bjorn made the point consistently and I also think he is right.

I would like to get Rob's opinion on this. I know he acked the DT
bindings (I have a comment on those too) but regardless, it is clearly a
property used for what is a command line configuration parameter,
no two ways about it.

Thanks,
Lorenzo

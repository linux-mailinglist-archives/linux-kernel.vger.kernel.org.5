See, it's not impossible. You can also determine whether you have a
multiport controller from looking at the interrupt names which are
indexed and distinct for MP.

That seem unnecessary currently, but long term we probably need to fix
the design of this driver and defer some setup using callbacks that are
called when the core driver probes. Perhaps now is the time to add such
functionality.

Again, no. The devicetree binding should describe the hardware
capabilities and that has nothing to do with whether you need this for
you current project or not.

As I've explained in earlier mails, I don't think that is acceptable as
you'd be dumping your technical debt on the community which will be left
to clean up your mess.

Using the 'compatible' or 'interrupt-names' properties seems like the
easiest way to determine whether you have an MP controller or not.

 The quirk is called unconditionally from `pci_device_add', so an attempt 
to unclamp will always happen with a working link for qualifying devices.

 I chose to leave the target speed at the most recent setting, because the 
link doesn't work in that case anyway, so I concluded it doesn't matter, 
but reduces messing with the device; technically you should retrain again 
afterwards.  I'm not opposed to changing this if you have a use case.

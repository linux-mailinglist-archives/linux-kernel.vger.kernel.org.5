Thanks for the idea. Actually I had a discussion with Vlastimil at LPC
'22 on a similar idea but for a different problem i.e. allocation in
irq context or more specifically charging sockets for incoming TCP
connections. If you see inet_csk_accept() we solved this for TCP
memory by charging at accept() syscall but the kernel memory holding
socket is still uncharged.

So, I think having the framework you suggested would help more
use-cases. I will take a stab at this in the next couple of days
(sorry stuck in some other stuff atm).

thanks,
Shakeel

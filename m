I have applied the following to branch ti-drivers-soc-next on [1].
Thank you!

[1/1] soc: ti: Explicitly include correct DT includes
      commit: cdbab28c3728e6c47228585eb6e84669518a1e7d

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent up the chain during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a relevant bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

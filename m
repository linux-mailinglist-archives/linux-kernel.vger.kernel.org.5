Subject: [PATCH 2/2] ring-buffer: Remove 32bit timestamp logic

From: "Steven Rostedt (Google)" <rostedt@goodmis.org>

Each event has a 27 bit timestamp delta that is used to hold the delta
from the last event. If the time between events is greater than 2^27, then
a timestamp is added that holds a 59 bit absolute timestamp.

Until a389d86f7fd09 ("ring-buffer: Have nested events still record running
time stamp"), if an interrupt interrupted an event in progress, all the
events delta would be zero to not deal with the races that need to be
handled. The commit a389d86f7fd09 changed that to handle the races giving
all events, even those that preempt other events, still have an accurate
timestamp.

To handle those races requires performing 64-bit cmpxchg on the
timestamps. But doing 64-bit cmpxchg on 32-bit architectures is considered
very slow. To try to deal with this the timestamp logic was broken into
two and then three 32-bit cmpxchgs, with the thought that two (or three)
32-bit cmpxchgs are still faster than a single 64-bit cmpxchg on 32-bit
architectures.

Part of the problem with this is that I didn't have any 32-bit
architectures to test on. After hitting several subtle bugs in this code,
an effort was made to try and see if three 32-bit cmpxchgs are indeed
faster than a single 64-bit. After a few people brushed off the dust of
their old 32-bit machines, tests were done, and even though 32-bit cmpxchg
was faster than a single 64-bit, it was in the order of 50% at best, not
300%.

After some more refactoring of the code, 3 of the 4 64-bit cmpxchg were
removed:

 https://lore.kernel.org/linux-trace-kernel/20231211114420.36dde01b@gandalf.local.home
 https://lore.kernel.org/linux-trace-kernel/20231214222921.193037a7@gandalf.local.home
 https://lore.kernel.org/linux-trace-kernel/20231215081810.1f4f38fe@rorschach.local.home

The last remaining 64-bit cmpxchg is only in a slow path and to keep the
next event from having to add an absolute timestamp. This is not worth the
trouble of a slow cmpxchg. Only do the cmpxchg on 64-bit architectures and
just have the 32-bit architectures insert an absolute timestamp for the
next event that comes after the slow path. The slow path only happens if
the event being recorded is interrupted between a few lines of code and
that interrupt writes an event into the same buffer. This seldom happens
and should not cause any issues by inserting an extra absolute timestamp
when it does happen.

Now the complex 32-bit workaround for 64-bit cmpxchg can be removed.

- * On 32 bit machines, local64_t is very expensive. As the ring
- * buffer doesn't need all the features of a true 64 bit atomic,
- * on 32 bit, it uses these functions (64 still uses local64_t).
- *
- * For the ring buffer, 64 bit required operations for the time is
- * the following:
- *
- *  - Reads may fail if it interrupted a modification of the time stamp.
- *      It will succeed if it did not interrupt another write even if
- *      the read itself is interrupted by a write.
- *      It returns whether it was successful or not.
- *
- *  - Writes always succeed and will overwrite other writes and writes
- *      that were done by events interrupting the current write.
- *
- *  - A write followed by a read of the same time stamp will always succeed,
- *      but may not contain the same value.
- *
- *  - A cmpxchg will fail if it interrupted another write or cmpxchg.
- *      Other than that, it acts like a normal cmpxchg.
- *
- * The 60 bit time stamp is broken up by 30 bits in a top and bottom half
- *  (bottom being the least significant 30 bits of the 60 bit time stamp).
- *
- * The two most significant bits of each half holds a 2 bit counter (0-3).
- * Each update will increment this counter by one.
- * When reading the top and bottom, if the two counter bits match then the
- *  top and bottom together make a valid 60 bit number.

This would be great material for comments and/or a revised commit log.

This doesn't really explain it for me, probably because of my IRQ
ignorance.

I compared xilinx_pl_dma (which uses chained interrupts) with
pci-aardvark.c (which does not).

  - xilinx_pl_dma_pcie_setup_irq() calls platform_get_irq(0) once and
    sets up xilinx_pl_dma_pcie_event_flow() as the handler.

  - advk_pcie_probe() calls platform_get_irq(0) once and sets up
    advk_pcie_irq_handler() as the handler.

  - xilinx_pl_dma_pcie_event_flow() reads XILINX_PCIE_DMA_REG_IDR to
    learn which interrupts are pending and calls
    generic_handle_domain_irq() for each.

  - advk_pcie_irq_handler() calls advk_pcie_handle_int(), which reads
    PCIE_ISR0_REG and PCIE_ISR1_REG to learn which interrupts are
    pending and calls generic_handle_domain_irq() for each.

It seems like both drivers do essentially the same thing, but
xilinx_pl_dma_pcie_event_flow() is a chained handler and
advk_pcie_irq_handler() is not.

Is there some underlying difference in the way the hardware works that
means xilinx_pl_dma needs a chained handler while aardvark does not?

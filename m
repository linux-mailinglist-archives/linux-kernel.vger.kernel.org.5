Does "legacy" mean "INTx" in this context?  If so, I'd use "INTx"
because it's much more specific.  "Legacy" really doesn't contain any
information other than "this is something retained for some kind of
backward compatibility."

If you have more detail about the "error interrupt," that would be
useful as well.  Does this refer to an AER interrupt, a "System
Error", something else?  I'm looking at the diagram in PCIe r6.0,
Figure 6-3, wondering if this is related to anything there.  I suppose
likely it's some Xilinx-specific thing?

I read Thomas' comments as "in general it's better to use regular
interrupts, but we can live with chained interrupts if we have control
of bootloader, device tree, and kernel."

I guess my questions are more like:

  - Could this be done with either chained interrupts or regular
    interrupts?

  - If so, what is the advantage to using chained interrupts?

Across the entire kernel, irq_set_chained_handler_and_data() is
relatively unusual, which makes me think it may be better to use the
more common path if it's possible.

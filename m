This can be solved by just not changing the generation id in the same
patch that fixes a bug, but as the last step in a series, which
doesn't add the cc: stable nor the other tags. If we want to bump the
generation id in a stable branch, we'll then have to send an
appropriately crafted patch targeted at the right place. That way even
if the fixes get backported, there is no additional burden on any
kernel maintainer.

Hi Johan,

  Thanks for these comments.

Yes, I can make a common helper to get IRQ's based on compatible. I also 
provided another implementation (which is more unambiguous and better I 
feel) on [1]. I will take one path forward based on your review of that 
patch as well.

Thanks a lot again for the reviews !

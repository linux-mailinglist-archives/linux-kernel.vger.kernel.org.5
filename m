RESOURCE_SIZE_MAX from limits.h.

Also I prefer the style

	struct resource_constraint constraint = {
		.max = RESOURCE_SIZE_MAX,
		.align = align,
	};

Thinking more about these checks, r->parent should be NULL for the root
resources, hence this check basically covers the second part of the above.

But like you said it's a material for a separate investigation.

Yeah, casting here is a compromise between good looking message and
kernel code.

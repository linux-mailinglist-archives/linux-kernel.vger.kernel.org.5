Thanks for the details. If we dont DISCONNECT when the USB link is NOT 
in bus suspend, the other alternatives we have are below ones

1.) Abort system_suspend: In addition to not honoring the users request 
to put the system in suspend, there is always a possibility of host 
driver never sending bus suspend interrupt. If that happens we would be 
denying system_suspend every time user requests it. So this is not a 
right approach.

2.) Keep the gadget connected and proceed with system_suspend: Now the 
system is suspended but from host point of view the USB link is active 
and would continue the communication normally. The signalling probably 
is not going to to be detected as a wakeup by the Rx hardware as there 
is no explicit resume signal involved here . The only exception is if we 
can somehow configure each and every event from the host as a wakeup 
signal(not sure if this is even possible)

So IMO it is best to DISCONNECT from the host when USB link is NOT in 
bus suspend state and user requests system_suspend.

Thanks
Elson

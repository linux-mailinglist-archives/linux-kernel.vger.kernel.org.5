I don't have a sense of the scope either. But I could see BIOS not enabling
features that would provide no added power savings benefit. We use ASPM to
manage package power. There are Intel devices that certainly don't require =
L1SS
for the SoC to achieve the deepest power savings. L1 alone is fine for them=
. I
don't know what the test coveragae is for unenabled features. I've sent the=
se
questions to our BIOS folks.

Good idea.

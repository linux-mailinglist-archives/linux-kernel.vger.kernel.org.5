This patch series adds "smart scanning" for KSM.

What is smart scanning?
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
KSM evaluates all the candidate pages for each scan. It does not use hist=
oric
information from previous scans. This has the effect that candidate pages=
 that
couldn't be used for KSM de-duplication continue to be evaluated for each=
 scan.

The idea of "smart scanning" is to keep historic information. With the hi=
storic
information we can temporarily skip the candidate page for one or several=
 scans.

Details:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
"Smart scanning" is to keep two small counters to store if the page has b=
een
used for KSM. One counter stores how often we already tried to use the pa=
ge for
KSM and the other counter stores when a page will be used as a candidate =
page
again.

How often we skip the candidate page depends how often a page failed KSM
de-duplication. The code skips a maximum of 8 times. During testing this =
has
shown to be a good compromise for different workloads.

New sysfs knob:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Smart scanning is not enabled by default. With /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/smart_s=
can
smart scanning can be enabled.

Monitoring:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
To monitor how effective smart scanning is a new sysfs knob has been intr=
oduced.
/sys/kernel/mm/pages_skipped report how many pages have been skipped by s=
mart
scanning.

Results:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
- Various workloads have shown a 20% - 25% reduction in page scans
  For the instagram workload for instance, the number of pages scanned ha=
s been
  reduced from over 20M pages per scan to less than 15M pages.
- Less pages scans also resulted in an overall higher de-duplication rate=
 as
  some shorter lived pages could be de-duplicated additionally
- Less pages scanned allows to reduce the pages_to_scan parameter
  and this resulted in  a 25% reduction in terms of CPU.
- The improvements have been observed for workloads that enable KSM with
  madvise as well as prctl


Changes:
  - V2:
    - Renamed function inc_skip_age() to skip_age()
    - Added comment to skip_age() function
    - Renamed function skip_rmap_item() to should_skip_rmap_item()
    - Added more comments to should_skip_rmap_item function
    - Added explicit modification of age with overflow check



Stefan Roesch (4):
  mm/ksm: add "smart" page scanning mode
  mm/ksm: add pages_skipped metric
  mm/ksm: document smart scan mode
  mm/ksm: document pages_skipped sysfs knob

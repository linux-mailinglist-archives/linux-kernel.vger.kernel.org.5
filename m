Thanks a lot for the report.

It's a false positive because the two stacktraces are identical
but pciehp_ist() is single-threaded.  There is only ever a single
instance of pciehp_ist() running per hotplug port, so two instances
running on separate CPUs can't happen:

lockdep doesn't appear to be smart enough to recognize that and
we do not have an annotation which would tell lockdep that a
particular function is always single-threaded.

From a brief look, amending lockdep to cope with such situations
seems non-trivial and I'm not sure if it happens frequently enough
to justify the additional complexity.

The only other option I see is to set lockdep_set_novalidate_class()
for the reset_lock.  However that will prevent us from detecting
*valid* issues with that lock.

Hm, that's a difficult decision...

Thanks,

Lukas

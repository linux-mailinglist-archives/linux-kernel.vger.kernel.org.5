As this change showed a really good improvement in my micro-benchmark, I
decided to give it a try on something that's a bit more of a real world
benchmark: PostgreSQL.

Hence, I'm also Cc'ing the postgres maintainers in case they are interested.
To bring them up to speed, here's what's been going on:

  A new feature is being discussed to add NEED_RESCHED_LAZY that will allow us
  (the kernel developers) to remove CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE and
  CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY, and move that to user space runtime switches. The
  idea is that when the scheduler tick goes off and it's time to schedule out a
  SCHED_OTHER task, user space can have the option of not doing that in the
  kernel and wait till it enters back into user space before scheduling
  (simulating PREEMPT_NONE). The scheduler tick will set NEED_RESCHED_LAZY
  (instead of NEED_RESCHED which always schedules when possible), and that bit
  will only be looked at when exiting back into user space, where it will
  perform the schedule if it is set.

  My idea is to extend this into user space as well. Using the restartable
  sequences infrastructure (https://lwn.net/Articles/697979/) that maps memory
  between kernel and user space for threads, I'll use two bits (or one bit and a
  counter, but that's for later, I'll just discuss the current implementation).

   bit 0: is set by user space to tell the kernel that it's in a critical
          section.

   bit 1: is set by the kernel telling user space that it granted it a bit more
          time and that it should call back into the kernel with any system call
          (sched_yield() or gettid()), when it is out of its critical section.

  Bit 1 will never be set if bit 0 is not set (Note, there's talk about making
  bit 0 the one set by the kernel, or use a different word entirely to allow
  the rest of the bits to be used as a counter for nested critical sections).

  Now when returning back to user space, if the critical section bit (or
  counter) is set, then it will not call schedule when NEED_RESCHED_LAZY is set.
  Note that it will still always call schedule on NEED_RESCHED. This gives user
  space one more tick (1 ms with 1000 HZ kernel config, to 4 ms with 250 HZ
  kernel config). When user space is done with its critical section, it should
  check the bit that can be set by the kernel to see if it should then schedule.

  If the user side bit is not cleared after a tick, then the kernel will set
  NEED_RESCHED which will force a schedule no matter where user space happens to
  be. Note, this could also hurt that task in that the scheduler will take away
  the eligibility of that task to balance out the amount of extra time the task
  ran for, not to mention, the force schedule could now land in a critical
  section.

Back in 2014 at the Linux Collaboration Summit in Napa Valley I had a nice
conversation with Robet Haas about user space spin locks. He told me how they
are used in PostgreSQL where futexes did not meet their needs. This
conversation kicked off the idea about implementing user space adaptive spin
locks (which last year in Belgium, I asked Andr√© Almeida to implement -
https://lwn.net/Articles/931789/).

Even though user space adaptive spinning would greatly help out the contention
of a lock, there's still the issue of a lock owner being preempted which would
cause all those waiters to also go into the kernel and delay access to the
critical sections. In the real time kernel, this was solved by
NEED_RESCHED_LAZY:

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-rt-devel.git/tree/patches/preempt-lazy-support.patch?h=v5.9-rc2-rt1-patches

Now Thomas has proposed using a similar solution to solve the PREEMPT_NONE /
VOLUNTARY issue.

  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87cyyfxd4k.ffs@tglx/

Which now has a prototype in the rt-devel tree:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-rt-devel.git/tree/patches/PREEMPT_AUTO.patch?h=v6.6-rc6-rt10-patches

For which I applied to v6.6-rc4 (my current working branch), and applied the
solution I explained above (POC with debugging still in it):

  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231025235413.597287e1@gandalf.local.home/

Now I downloaded the latest postgres from:

  https://github.com/postgres/postgres.git

And built sha: 26f988212eada9c586223cbbf876c7eb455044d9

After installing it, I rebooted the machine with the updated kernel (requires
CONFIG_PREEMPT_AUTO being set), and ran the unmodified version of postgres
pgbench test:

  pgbench -c 100 -T 300 -j 8 -S -n

I ran it 16 times and looked at the transactions per second counter (tps).
Note, I threw out the first run as it had horrible numbers probably due to
everything in cold cache (memory and file system).

Then I applied the below patch, did a make clean, make install, rebooted the
box again and ran the test for another 16 times (again, the first run was
horrible).

Here are the results of the tests: I only used the 15 runs after the first run
for comparisons.

Without the patched postgres executable:

  First run:
    tps = 72573.188203 (without initial connection time)

  15 runs:
    tps = 74315.731978 (without initial connection time)

    tps = 74792.563116 (without initial connection time)
    tps = 74852.101317 (without initial connection time)

Without the patch:

    Average: 74527.7800
    Std Dev: 420.6304

With the patch:
    Average: 74710.0988
    Std Dev: 136.7250

Notes about my setup. I ran this on one of my older test boxes (pretty much the
last of the bare metal machines I test on, as now I do most on VMs, but did not
want to run these tests on VMs).

It's a 4 core (2 hyper threaded) total of 8 CPUs:

  Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz

 32G of RAM.

Postgres has several types of locks. I first applied the extend()/unextend() to
only the raw spin locks but that didn't make much difference. When I traced
it, I found that the time slice seldom landed when one of these spin locks
were held. 10 or so during a 5 minute run (I added writes to the kernel
tracing buffer via trace_marker to know when the locks were held, and also
recorded sched_switch to see if it was ever preempted). So I expanded the
usage to the "light weight locks" (lwlocks), which are similar to the spin
locks but does some complex backing off. Basically a heuristic spin. Anyway,
after adding the logic to these locks, it definitely made a difference. Not a
huge one, but it was noticeable beyond the noise. I can imagine that if this
was implemented on a machine with many more CPUs than 8, it would make an even
bigger difference.

I also had to rerun my tests because I left some kernel config options enabled
that affected performance. I didn't want that to skew the results. But the
results were similar, except that with the slower kernel, the worse
performance with the patch was better than the best performance without it.
Not by much, but still. After removing the slowdown, that was no longer the
case. But I noticed that with the patch, the standard deviation was much
smaller than without the patch. I'm guessing that without the patch it depends
on how the scheduler interacts with the locking much more and a good run
without the patch was just the test being "lucky" that it didn't get preempted
as much in a critical section.

I personally think the smaller standard deviation is a win as it makes the
database run with a more deterministic behavior.

Anyway, I'd really like to know what others think about this, and perhaps they
can run this on their own testing infrastructure. All the code is available to
reproduce. If you want to reproduce it like I did. Checkout the latest Linus
tree (or do what I have which is v6.6-rc4), apply the above mentioned
PREEMPT_AUTO.patch, then apply my kernel patch. Select CONFIG_PREEMPT_AUTO and
build the kernel. Don't worry about that big banner that is on the kernel
console at boot up telling you that you are running a debug kernel. You are
running one, and it's because I still have a couple of trace_printk()s in it.

Run your postgres tests with and without the patch and let me know if there's a
difference. Only if you think it's worth it. Let me know if you don't ;-)

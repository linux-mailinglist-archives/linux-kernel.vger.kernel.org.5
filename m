You appear to be saying that when wakeup is disabled, unplugging a 
device will wake up the system -- but when wakeup is enabled, unplugging 
a device will not wake up the system!

Is that really what you meant?  It doesn't make sense.  Probably means 
there's a bug in the HCD.

The point I'm trying to get at is that if wakeups are disabled for both 
the host controller and the root hub then _nothing_ should generate an 
interrupt or wakeup request.  Not pressing a key, not unplugging a 
device... nothing.  But if wakeup _is_ enabled for both the controller 
and the root hub, then any of those actions should generate an interrupt 
and wake up the system.

If wakeup is enabled for the host controller but not for the root hub, 
then unplugging a device from the root hub should not generate a wakeup 
request or an interrupt.  But things like pressing a key on a 
wakeup-enabled keyboard should.  (In other words, the root hub shouldn't 
generate any wakeup requests on its own but it should relay wakeup 
requests that it receives from downstream devices.)  However, it's 
understandable if the system doesn't behave properly in this case since 
it's kind of an odd situation.

resctrl_arch_update_domains()? This also has lockdep_assert_cpus_held(), which is taken by
rdtgroup_kn_lock_live() - this pattern covers all the user-space filesystem operations.

I'd really like to get all the resctrl_arch_* helpers away from depending on
rdtgroup_mutex. Part of this is to allow perf/kvm/etc to use this interface without having
to expose more things from resctrl.

(Isn't this an existing problem? All I'm doing here is making it something explicitly
supported).

For the overflow interrupt, the irqchip code passes the device to the irq handler, which
corresponds to the MSC and via some intermediate structure, the resctrl domain. So this is
cheap to look up.

The need to 'walk the list in IRQ context' really comes from perf, regardless of whether
the overflow interrupt is supported. The domain_id is cached, but the domain may go
offline before the PMU driver is next called, hence the need to search the list and check
the CPU each time. If this proves to be a bottleneck, we can look for a better data structure.
The domain list is sorted, so a bisect search would improve matters.
A hash table may work for x86, as far as I can see the cache-ids are where the domain-id
always comes from, and those values are picked by the kernel to be contiguous. (on arm64
they come from a firmware table, all we know is they should be unique).

resctrl_arch_find_domain() is a per-arch thing, so we can do whatever is best for each
architecture.


For your resctrl_arch_update_domains() example, x86 could dispatch an IPI to each CPU,
passing the necessary domain in msr_param as part of the main loop. This would be slower
for the caller as you'd have to wait for each one to complete, but it would avoid a CPU in
each domain having to search the domain list with interrupts masked. (possibly all at the
same time)
I figure schema updates are rare, and it doesn't matter how long they take, provided it
doesn't impact other tasks.

Ultimately, I don't know. It's something the architecture supports, I think its most
useful for use with perf-record. I've not had anyone ask for this support yet.

MPAM can have bandwidth counters as small as 32bit and can count in bytes. If someone
builds this configuration, they may find the overflow interrupt goes off more frequently
than the overflow thread runs to scrub the counters.

MPAM also has options to scale the counters by some implementation specific size, as well
as 44 and 63 bit counters - all of which should overflow less frequently.

As with everything in the arm world, its very much "chose your own adventure".


Thanks,

James

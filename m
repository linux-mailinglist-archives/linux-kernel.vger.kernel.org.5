So this series will give a warning for the remaining nvidia driver but 
Thierry just send the changes to get rid of the thermal_core.h (Thanks!)

AFAICT, the last user of the thermal_zone_device structure is the 
int340x driver but the patch fixing the structure internal usage is 
already in the bleeding edge (well perhaps one nit is missing for the trace)

As soon as the bindings are acked, then I can pick the patches from 
Thierry which will end up in your tree. Then you can apply the current 
series. And finally I'll send the last patch moving the thermal zone 
device structure to the thermal_core.h. And we will be done with this part.

Having a compilation warning (I would prefer a more coercive error if we 
agree on that) will help to not have to double check every time 
thermal_core.h is not pulled in the drivers when patches are submitted.

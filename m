And that's the problem of the driver, no? It's not the job of the kernel 
developers to be aware of each out-of-tree driver to not accidentally 
break something in there.

If you decide to be out-of-tree, then you have be prepared to only 
support tested kernels and fix your driver when something changes 
upstream -- like upstream developers would do for you when it would be 
in-tree.

So why can't the out-of-tree driver be fixed, similarly to how we would 
have fixed it if it would be in-tree?

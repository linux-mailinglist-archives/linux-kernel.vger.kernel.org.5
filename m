Traditionally, user-facing "SWIOTLB" refers to what is now dma-direct, 
in its context of bouncing to make DMA mappings accessible to devices 
with memory access limitations. The fact that the IOMMU implementations 
(originally Intel, now iommu-dma) also co-opted some of the SWIOTLB 
machinery for the very different purpose of isolation of memory 
*outside* non-page-aligned DMA mappings was always more of an internal 
implementation detail.

The newest use for enforcing non-coherent cacheline alignment blurs the 
boundary a little since its purpose is again largely orthogonal to those 
cases, however it's also one to which "swiotlb=force" is semantically 
kind of meaningless once you think about it (how does one forcibly align 
a buffer which is already suitably aligned?)

If there's any issue here I'd say it's only that the description in 
kernel-parameters.txt still hasn't been updated since "automatically 
used by the kernel" *did* solely imply a device DMA mask limitation.

Thanks,
Robin.

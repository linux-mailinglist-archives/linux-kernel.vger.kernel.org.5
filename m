It's in the above patch header. The power at 600MHz is ~1.5Watts, so for
max freq and max voltage you get the coefficient. The DT schema
describes quite well how the coefficient is calculated. IMO, there is no
need to duplicate that description here [1].

Have you checked that documentation? Is there still anything unclear?
I might elaborate a bit more why it's important for GPU to take the top
OPP for considerations (due to thermal operating mostly on top-half
OPPs, but the curve is a bit constraining). Unfortunately, this simple
model doesn't allow to reflect the leakage impact over time. It doesn't
also address the chip binning lottery. Although, it will be possible in
near future to address those [2].

Regards,
Lukasz

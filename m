Yes, that would be a reasonable argument to keep both values instead
of storing just the intersection.

Bjorn has used phrases such as "We're about to ..." a couple of times
in commit messages to convey that a particular change in the present
patch will be taken advantage of by a subsequent patch.

I've used the same phrase but got criticized (in other subsystems)
for using "we".

So I use phrases such as:

 "An upcoming commit will create DOE mailboxes upon device enumeration by
  the PCI core.  Their lifetime shall not be limited by a driver.
  Therefore rework..." (see 022b66f38195)

Can also reference the past:

 "The PCI core has just been amended to create a pci_doe_mb struct for
  every DOE instance on device enumeration.  [...]  That leaves [...]
  without any callers, so drop them." (see 74e491e5d1bc)

If someone finds your commit e.g. through git blame, it may help them
enormously if you provide context in the commit message.  If maintainers
in other subsystem tell you otherwise, they're wrong. ;)

Thanks,

Lukas

QEMU is referenced to explain `vmgenid` which they are also using and 
have more documentation on it. We mentioned the hypervisor we tested the 
changes with in the cover letter which is 
https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker but this change isn't 
VMM specific.

The hypervisor we work on 
(https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker) does not have 
fw_cfg, it loads kernel directly without the need for UEFI or any 
intermediate firmware. It is, as said, an overkill to enable UEFI and 
fw_cfg just to support `vmgenid` specially when there is an alternative 
available which could keep things simple for the vmm and for the linux 
driver.

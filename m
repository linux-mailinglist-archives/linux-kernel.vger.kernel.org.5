The scenario that first came to mind for you, specifically the verity 
root hash, is in fact a form of signature checking assessment. A 
signature is nothing more than saying here is a hash with provenance 
that is enforced by the measuring entity. For a PKI signature, e.g. UEFI 
Secure Boot, the provenance is confirming that the encrypted portion of 
the signature can be decrypted using the CA public key. For the case of 
dm-verity, the provenance of the hash is its source, that it came from 
the command line. If you consider the consequences presented for a 
signature checking assessment, one should see the same issues with 
dm-verity: 1) any logic in the kernel, intended or injected, could 
tamper with the validation of the hash, 2) there is no evidence of each
block hashed into the final hash that is assessed, and 3) the system is 
responsible to ensure only the correct hash has been provided on the 
command line.

Another way to consider the above, there are always two actions for 
assessing integrity, measurement and assessment. When both actions are 
delegated to a single entity along with a mechanism to provide the known 
good, this is a signature checking assessment. When these two actions 
are delegated to two separate entities, this is a cryptographic hashing 
assessment. In TCG parlance, the former is a Root of Trust for 
Verification (RTV) chain and the latter is a Root of Trust for 
Measurement (RTM) chain.

And to clarify the example provided by Ross in using the TPM seal 
method. This is a cryptographic hashing assessment, as the two functions 
are done by separate entities. The software makes the measurements while 
the TPM makes the assessment. In theory, the solution employing a TPM 
seal will have established what the expected sequence of measurements 
should be, and ensured the TPM seal was the final and correct measurement.

I don't know if you will find it too rudimentary, but I feel I did a 
fairly decent job covering on this in the first ever TrenchBoot talk[1].

I am very glad to hear you found it helpful. This is a very complex 
topic, and trying to break it all down for an audience that may have 
zero background and an interest to help is no small undertaking.

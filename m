He wants to expose a list of supported protocols.

He first exposed the list in a single attribute, separated by newlines.
Which made sense because it allows users to grep for a specific protocol.

You told him not to expose multiple values in a single attribute.
So he's exposing the available protocols each in an empty file.
The file name contains the protocol.

You got what you asked for. ;)

People with space-constrained devices such as routers.

It is perfectly legal to compile a kernel with CONFIG_PCI=y and
CONFIG_SYSFS=n.

And it is reasonable not to include code in the kernel which has
specifically been deselected in the kernel config.

Thanks,

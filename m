Hi again,

I went to check Root Ports on some machines and toggled their Link=20
Disable bit on. None of the Root Ports I tested cleared LBMS. That means
LBMS being on after resume is not enough to differentiate the HW which=20
needs Target Speed quirk and which does not. Unless we clear LBMS at some=
=20
point which was what this patch tried to do.

So this misidentification problem in the quirk looks quite widespread but=
=20
is mostly dormant because Links do come up normally so the quirk code is=20
never called.

I might conduct even larger set of tests once I script a way to=20
automatically pick a "safe" Root Port (something that is connected to a=20
device but unused, I manually picked Root Ports above unused NICs for the=
=20
manual tests I already did). But I don't believe it changes anything and=20
in the end I won't find any Root Ports that would actually clear LBMS on=20
their own when Link goes down.

So I would be really curious now to know how you get the LBMS on the=20
device that needs the Target Speed quirk? Is this true (from the commit=20
a89c82249c37 ("PCI: Work around PCIe link training failures")):

"Instead the link continues oscillating between the two speeds, at the=20
rate of 34-35 times per second, with link training reported repeatedly=20
active ~84% of the time."

?

Because if it is constantly picking another speed, it would mean you get=20
LBMS set over and over again, no? If that happens 34-35 times per second,=
=20
it should be set already again when we get into that quirk because there=20
was some wait before it gets called.

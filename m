You still need a pte-pte loop somewhere. In hugetlb's case it's in the arch
implementation. HugeTLB ptes are all a fixed size for a given VMA, which makes
things a bit easier too, whereas in the regular mm, they are now a variable size.

David and I introduced folio_pte_batch() to help gather batches of ptes, and it
uses the contpte bit to avoid iterating over intermediate ptes. And I'm adding
swap_pte_batch() which does a similar thing for swap entry batching in v4 of my
swap-out series.

For your set_ptes_to_swap_entries() example, I'm not sure what it would do other
than loop over the PTEs setting an incremented swap entry to each one? How is
that more performant?

Thanks,
Ryan

Yes, the ExternalFacingPort applies to root ports so that includes
everything below that.

This has been working just fine so far and as far as I can tell there is
no such "policy" in place in the mainline kernel.

There is really nothing "unique" here. It's exactly as specified by
this:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/pci/dsd-for-pcie-root-ports#identifying-externally-exposed-pcie-root-ports

and being used in many many system already out there and those have been
working just fine.

This is not scalable at all. You would need to include lots of systems
here. And there should be no issue at all anyways.

Can you elaborate what the issue is and which mainline kernel you are
using to reproduce this?

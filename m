This much regression is not acceptable.

In addition, I ran netperf with the same 4 level hierarchy as you have
run and I am seeing ~11% regression.

More specifically on a machine with 44 CPUs (HT disabled ixion machine):

# for server
$ netserver -6

# 22 instances of netperf clients
$ netperf -6 -H ::1 -l 60 -t TCP_SENDFILE -- -m 10K

(averaged over 4 runs)

base (next-20231009): 33081 MBPS
patched: 29267 MBPS

So, this series is not acceptable unless this regression is resolved.

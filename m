That correct.

Yes, it prevents that previous situation. I have added a debug print
before your return in the code above and the it's in the log:

[    1.632520] thermal_sys: TZ: THERMAL_TEMP_INVALID, return
[    1.638899] thermal_sys: TZ: THERMAL_TEMP_INVALID, return

The tracing also shows that we have only 1s slow polling.
It also works properly in IPA when crossing 2 trip points
and coming back to low temp.

So, that code above should be OK. Thanks!

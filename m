That should probably say "IMX5/6" nowadays. There are a lot more i.MX
that do not use IPUv3 than those that do.

I used to send pull requests from git.pengutronix.de/git/pza/linux,
same as for the reset controller framework. I might still have to do
that for changes in drivers/gpu/ipu-v3 that need coordination between
drm and v4l2, but usually pure drm/imx/ipuv3 changes are pushed to drm-
misc.

The "N: imx" pattern in "ARM/FREESCALE IMX / MXC ARM ARCHITECTURE", I
think.

Yes, both would be great.

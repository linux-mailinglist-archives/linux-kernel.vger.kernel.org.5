So I've checked some more and the kernel doc comments before
mode_strip_umask() and vfs_prepare_mode() make it pretty obvious - all
paths creating new inodes must be calling vfs_prepare_mode(). As a result
mode_strip_umask() which handles umask stripping for filesystems not
supporting posix ACLs. For filesystems that do support ACLs,
posix_acl_create() must be call and that handles umask stripping. So your
fix should not be needed. CCed some relevant people for confirmation.

I agree having umask stripping in two places is not great but it's
difficult to avoid with how posix ACLs are implemented and intertwined in
various filesystem implementations. At least the current design made it
quite a bit harder to forget to strip the umask.

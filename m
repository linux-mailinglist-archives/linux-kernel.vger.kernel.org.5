Thanks for your patch, which is now commit 584ea6564bcaead2 ("RISC-V:
Probe for unaligned access speed") in v6.6-rc1.

On the boards I have, I get:

    rzfive:
        cpu0: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is
1.05, unaligned accesses are fast

    icicle:

        cpu1: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is
0.00, unaligned accesses are slow
        cpu2: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is
0.00, unaligned accesses are slow
        cpu3: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is
0.00, unaligned accesses are slow

        cpu0: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is
0.00, unaligned accesses are slow

    k210:

        cpu1: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is
0.02, unaligned accesses are slow
        cpu0: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is
0.02, unaligned accesses are slow

    starlight:

        cpu1: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is
0.01, unaligned accesses are slow
        cpu0: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is
0.02, unaligned accesses are slow

    vexriscv/orangecrab:

        cpu0: Ratio of byte access time to unaligned word access is
0.00, unaligned accesses are slow

I am a bit surprised by the near-zero values.  Are these expected?
Thanks!

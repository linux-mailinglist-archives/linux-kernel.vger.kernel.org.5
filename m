If the dynamic version is clear and obvious then fair enough. I tried doing
something similar for the swap-out series but it turned out a mess, so ended up
falling back to static allocation which was much easier to understand.

That all looks like a complete mess - better avoided if possible! A quick search
for "for_each_possible_cpu" shows loads of places where code is iterating over
all *possible* cpus and grabbing its per-cpu data. So the data definitely
remains accessible when the cpu is offline. Looks like it doesn't get wiped either.

So can't you just change your sum function to iterate over all possible cpus?

Well I thought you were interested in isolating fallback due to fragmentation
only. You would get that with (FAULT_FALLBACK - FAULT_FALLBACK_CHARGE)? But if
you think the latter will be relatively small/unimportant for now, and therefore
FAULT_FALLBACK will give good enough approximation on its own, then I'm happy
not to add FAULT_FALLBACK_CHARGE for now.

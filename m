In this case, the effective CPUs of both mid1a and mid2 will be empty. 
IOW, you can't have any task in these 2 cpusets.

For the remote case, you can have intermediate tasks in both mid1a and 
mid2 as long as cpuset.cpus contains more CPUs than cpuset.cpus.exclusive.

They will be ready eventually. This requirement of remote partition 
actually came from our OpenShift team as the use of just local partition 
did not meet their need. They don't need access to exclusive CPUs in the 
parent cgroup layer for their management daemons. They do need to 
activate isolated partition in selected child cgroups to support our 
Telco customers to run workloads like DPDK.

So they will add the support to upstream Kubernetes.

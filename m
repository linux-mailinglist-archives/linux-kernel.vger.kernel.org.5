There is no 'system as a whole' that can use GP 'uniformly'

The EFI stub is a separate executable that runs from a different
mapping of memory, in an execution context managed by the firmware. It
happens to be linked into the same executable as the vmlinux kernel.

GP is not loaded because in the EFI firmware context, there is no safe
way to rely on it.

So what solution are you proposing for the potential GP conflicts
between the boot loader, the Linux EFI stub and the firmware?

 No worries.  I have submitted the changes now: 
<https://lore.kernel.org/r/alpine.DEB.2.21.2402092125070.2376@angie.orcam.me.uk/>.

 Unfortunately due to a sudden hardware failure I wasn't able to do any
non-trivial verification, as explained in the cover letter.  I'll try to 
get back to it as soon as reasonably possible, hopefully next month.

 I decided to do it differently after all, still with two changes.  There 
doesn't have to be any intermediate state, and returning failure where no 
retraining has been done is no different from the case where a failure was 
caused by the lack of hardware features required, such as link active 
reporting, so if callers work without this update, then so they will with 
it in place (i.e. no regression).

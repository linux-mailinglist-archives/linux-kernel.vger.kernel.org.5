Perhaps we could get that fixed...?

Happy to do so. Since it seems this enum doesn't have all the constants
I'd need to avoid conflicting with, I might need some help here :)

Eh?

Most of the constants here appear to be completely filesystem specific -
I see UDF, nilfs, btrfs, fat...

And since you also don't want conflicts with fid_types that aren't
defined here, it seems like they really should all be here.

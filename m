Yes.  My point is that this only affects the write path, and the read
probably does not read 0 as it should.  This means lspci will show the
wrong thing, and the PCI core will try to size the BAR when it doesn't
need to.  I haven't looked at the BAR sizing code; it might even come
up with a bogus size and address, when it *should* just conclude the
BAR doesn't exist at all.

Thanks for this valuable information!  This NVMe issue potentially
affects many similar drivers, and we may need a more generic fix so
this device works well with all of them.

T_PVPERL is defined to start when power is stable.  Do you have a way
to accurately determine that point?  I'm guessing this:

  gpiod_set_value_cansleep(pcie->power_gpio, 1)

turns the power on?  But of course that doesn't mean it is instantly
stable.  Maybe your testing is telling you that your driver should
have a hardware-specific 200ms delay to wait for power to become
stable, followed by the standard 100ms for T_PVPERL?

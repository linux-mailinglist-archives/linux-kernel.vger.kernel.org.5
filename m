At the time it was written, the intention was not to fix any particular
interrupt as wakeup but leave those details to the device. Also this was
just to consolidate various variation of similar bindings/support for the
same wake feature. It didn't enforce any rules as what can be or can't be
wakeup interrupt.

Again I agree with this.

Above wordings sounds good to me.

You are right, the root complex itself is (likely) not an ARM design.
I should have said "... unlike many other Root Complexes used in similar ARM CPU based SoCs ...".
The Cyclone V SoC sub-family of FPGAs features a dual core Cortex A9.
The "Cyclone V SoC Development Kit" is a development kit that exposes a readily usable PCIe root slot.

The CPU subsystem and the PCIe IP are hard IP in silicon and can not be altered.
They are connected via the FPGA logic, though, and I agree one approach could be to intercept their communication with custom HDL.
However, Linux uses the exact same PCIe hard IP registers required for IO TLPs to send Config TLPs.
Every TLP requires multiple accesses to multiple registers, so locking between FPGA logic and Linux transactions would be required.
I'm not saying that this is impossible, but I don't think it can be robust without a Linux software change.
A software only solution has the benefit of being available to all users of such an FPGA, without access to that special logic.

The AX99100 implements a so called "Legacy Endpoint" and is thus allowed to rely on support for IO space.
I guess this choice was made to stay driver-compatible to the PCI version, although I don't know the ancestry if this product.

Best regards, David

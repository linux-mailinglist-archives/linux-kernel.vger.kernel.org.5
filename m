There are serious flaws with reparenting that I mentioned above. We do
it for kernel memory, but that's because we really have no other
choice. Oftentimes the memory is not reclaimable and we cannot find an
owner for it. This doesn't mean it's the right answer for user memory.

The semantics are new compared to normal charging (as opposed to
recharging, as I explain below). There is an extra layer of
indirection that we did not (as far as I know) measure the impact of.
Parents end up with pages that they never used and we have no
observability into where it came from. Most importantly, over time
user memory will keep accumulating at the root, reducing the accuracy
and usefulness of accounting, effectively an accounting leak and
reduction of capacity. Memory that is not attributed to any user, aka
system overhead.

I believe recharging is being mis-framed here :)

Recharging semantics are not new, it is a shortcut to a process that
is already happening that is focused on offline memcgs. Let's take a
step back.

It is common practice (at least in my knowledge) to try to reclaim
memory from a cgroup before deleting it (by lowering the limit or
using memory.reclaim). Reclaim heuristics are biased towards
reclaiming memory from offline cgroups. After the memory is reclaimed,
if it is used again by a different process, it will be refaulted and
charged again (aka recharged) to the new

What recharging is doing is *not* anything new. It is effectively
doing what reclaim + refault would do above, with an efficient
shortcut. It avoids the unnecessary fault, avoids disrupting the
workload that will access the memory after it is reclaimed, and cleans
up zombie memcgs memory faster than reclaim would. Moreover, it works
for memory that may not be reclaimable (e.g. because of lack of swap).

All the indeterministic behaviors in recharging are exactly the
indeterministic behaviors in reclaim. It is very similar. We iterate
the lrus, try to isolate and lock folios, etc. This is what reclaim
does. Recharging is basically lightweight reclaim + charging again (as
opposed to fully reclaiming the memory then refaulting it).

We are not introducing new indeterminism or charging semantics.
Recharging does exactly what would happen when we reclaim zombie
memory. It is just more efficient and accelerated.

 I hope the above arguments change your mind :)

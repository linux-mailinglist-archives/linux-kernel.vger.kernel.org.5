Thanks for the information.


It looks like "perf lock record" requests both tracepoint types.


However, on the system I used the lockdep tracepoints were not available 
- only lock:contention_begin/end.

With the caveat that only lock:contention_begin/end were available in my 
test, there does appear to be a difference in output for perf lock report.


I arrived at 688d2e8de231 via git bisect. 688d2e8de231~ (eca949b2b4ad) 
shows the aggregate-by-caller behaviour (seen below, and "restored" by 
this patch).

This was the default output before this patch (or output with the patch 
and "-l"), I can clarify this if the patch goes ahead.

Yes, the lockdep tracepoints weren't available for my test, although on 
the same machine, versions prior to 688d2e8de231 appear to show the 
below output rather than the above.

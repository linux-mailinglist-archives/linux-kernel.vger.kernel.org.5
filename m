I can't say I'm crazy about this.

Let's say you have a fairly sprawling and active cgroup tree with lots
of updates in lots of groups in the system.

Add a periodic memory.stat reader to one of the subgroups, and that
reader will do very fast, localized aggregation.

Now add a periodic memory.stat reader to some other subgroup. They
might still both do very fast, localized aggregation. Or they might
collide; and now - despite having nothing in common, and sharing no
data besides the rstat lock - will have to flush the entire massive
tree. The rate at which this happens is purely dependent on timing of
what should be independent actors. This is really not great for the
p50 vs p99 gap.

I think this whole thing is getting away from us.

When we first switched to rstat, every reader would take the global
rstat lock and then flush its local subtree of interest.

This was changed in the following commit:

commit fd25a9e0e23b995fd0ba5e2f00a1099452cbc3cf
Author: Shakeel Butt <shakeelb@google.com>

    memcg: unify memcg stat flushing
    
    The memcg stats can be flushed in multiple context and potentially in
    parallel too.  For example multiple parallel user space readers for
    memcg stats will contend on the rstat locks with each other.  There is
    no need for that.  We just need one flusher and everyone else can
    benefit.
    
    In addition after aa48e47e3906 ("memcg: infrastructure to flush memcg
    stats") the kernel periodically flush the memcg stats from the root, so,
    the other flushers will potentially have much less work to do.

The idea was that we can avoid lock contention if somebody is already
doing the flushing. However, you're now bringing global serialization.
Clearly that idea didn't work out. What would be an obstacle to go
back to the original way of doing it?

With one reader, this will work the same as in your proposal.

With two readers, just like in your proposal, flushing must be
serialized against the root level. But at least the two flushes only
aggregate the local data they actually care about - not the entire
tree data that doesn't even have readers! This is much better for lock
contention and performance.

One concern is the thresholding code. The cost of flushing on every
read is too high: even when there is no flush work, checking for it is
kind of expensive due to the locks and the for_each_possible_cpu().

Could we do something like the following?

	mem_cgroup_flush(memcg)
	{
		mutex_lock(&memcg_flush_mutex);
		if (atomic_read(&memcg->stat_delta) > THRESHOLD)
			cgroup_rstat_flush(memcg);
		mutex_unlock(&memcg_flush_mutex);
	}

	mem_cgroup_css_rstat_flush(css, cpu)
	{
		...
		/*
		 * Reset here instead of mem_cgroup_flush()
		 * so that each flushed subgroup is reset
		 * recursively. A recent parent flush will
		 * allow a child flush to skip.
		 */
		atomic_set(&mem_cgroup_from_css(css)->stat_delta, 0);
	}

	memcg_rstat_updated(memcg, val)
	{
		atomic_add(&memcg->stat_delta, val);
	}

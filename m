Sure, I have no objection to making dma-debug more robust and useful for 
its intended purpose, I was just commenting on the fact that any 
potential change in behaviour from this should be of less concern to 
distros than the significant change in behaviour that enabling it 
*already* poses (i.e. globally serialising DMA operations and doing 
inherently slow stuff in what are normally expected to be fast paths).

Thanks,
Robin.

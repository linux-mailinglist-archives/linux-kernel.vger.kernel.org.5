After spending more time on it I'm starting to reach a similar conclusion,
but I'm not yet convinced it's so much the system being overloaded as it
is the handling for KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES being particularly punishing
for this sort of workload and starving vCPUs for execution time due to
it causing MMU invalidations that cause #NPFs to need restarting and
frequent NMIs due KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH requests. For non-CoCo guests I think
this activity would be much more infrequent.

For instance here's the journey of a particular 4MB range that ends up
triggering a soft-lockup in the guest according to host-side ftraces (in
this case I've disabled the additional 2MB region that gets taken for
the zero-padding issue, and implemented the bug fix mentioned earlier,
so there vCPUs don't ever end up waiting on each other):

== Acceptance for 4MB GPA range 0x18cbc00000:18cc000000 ==

It's a pretty wild ride that spans 38s across 4 CPUs. I seem to get these
for 2 or 3 unlucky GPA ranges for each run and the other ranges stay
well below the soft-lockup threshold.

Maybe there are ways to improve on that situation, like accepting using
larger chunk sizes (which is sort of the opposite of what I was suggesting
earlier, but maybe when done to a degree that significantly batches
invalidations and KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH requests it becomes less of an issue to
have vCPUs waiting on each other).

Maybe if larger chunk sizes / more batching does end up helping, a
worker thread/pool of this sort makes even more sense. But maybe there
are simpler ways to experiment with that.

It just seemed like a) was more similar to the original issue of threads
becoming serialized on a few CPUs, but with the changes noted above to
completely decouple vCPUs from each other I was still able to trigger soft
lock-ups, but instead of a storm of lock-ups from vCPU threads suffering
secondary effects, these were purely lock-ups of type b), which
point to there ultimately being something on the host-side which was
causing all the threads to trip over themselves.

Indeed, with 2) and 3) addressed there no longer seem to be any

Sure, I will get that posted by tomorrow after a bit more testing.

Yah, I think it was helpful for getting rid of some noise and getting a
better idea of the main source of the bottleneck, but the underlying issue
still remains even with these changes in place. 

I'll continue to experiment with it, but it makes me feel better at least
that there isn't something strange going on with the current guest-side
implementation.

Thanks,

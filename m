Please mention that in the commit message.

As an alternative to disabling ACS, have you explored masking ACS
Violations (PCI_ERR_UNC_ACSV) upon de-enumeration of a device and
unmasking them after assignment of a bus number?

That would alleviate concerns that disabling ACS Source Validation
weakens security (because it doesn't have to be disabled in the
first place).

You'd need to clear the ACS Violation Status bit in the Uncorrectable
Error Status Register though after assignment of a bus number,
in addition to unmasking it, because that bit is still set despite
the error being masked.

The kernel affords a generous 60 sec timeout for devices to become
ready (PCIE_RESET_READY_POLL_MS) and is not dependent on DRS messages
coming through, so blocking them with ACS shouldn't cause issues.

The problem is that devices may be removed only logically (via sysfs
"power" attribute or Attention Button) and still remain in the system
physically.  They may spoof messages until they're physically removed
or the hotplug slot is brought up again.

By "filtered" I meant that TLPs are blocked by ACS.  Sorry for the
confusing word choice.

Thanks,

What ? If the number of hw tags you have for your device is larger than what the
device can actually handle, that means that your device driver is very buggy. A
hw tag is a direct identifier of queued commands on the device side. So you
cannot have more than what the device allows.

May be you are confusing this with the fact that even if you have the correct
maximum number of hw tags, the device may sometimes refuse to accept a new
command using a free tag. E.g. a scsi device may return TSF (task set full) even
if its queue is not full (some hw tags are free). But that is not the common case.

As for the commands not being arranged in priority order when submitted, that is
also strange. You are going to get the commands from the scheduler in priority
order, so they will be sorted naturally as such in the dispatch queue, unless
you get a lot of requeue from the device (again, generally not the usual case).

May be that is exactly what you need to do to solve your issue: implement that
for emmc. Have you tried ?

I was more thinking that perhaps we should think of .deinit() as in how
dw_pcie_ep_init() used to be. It was not allowed to have any DBI writes.
(The DBI writes were all in dw_pcie_ep_init_complete()).
So perhaps we could define that a EPF .deinit() callback is not allowed
to have any DBI writes.

If we take qcom-ep as an example, as soon as you get a PERST assertion
the qcom-ep driver calls notify_deinit(), then asserts the reset control,
disables clocks and regulators.

Since the PCIe core is held in reset, the hardware is in a well defined
state, no? Sure, the data structures e.g. bar_to_iatu[], etc., might be
out of sync, but these could be memset():ed no? Since this is a fundamental
reset, all registers should be reset to their default state (once reset
is deasserted).

For a real PCIe card, if you assert + msleep(100) + deassert PERST, surely
the endpoint is supposed to be in a good/well defined state, regardless if
he REFCLK was cutoff at the exact time as PERST was asserted or not?

I would assume that we would want a PCI EPF driver to behave the same way,
if possible.


Kind regards,
Niklas

Oh, please don't say that, it seems like you are the only one causing
the fight. We deeply respect the opinions of file system developers, so
I invited Dave to this thread from the beginning. And you didnâ€™t CC
linux-fsdevel@vger.kernel.org yourself.

(Disclaimer, no intention to start a fight, here are some objective
views.)

Why not? In addition to printk, there are many good debugging tools
worth trying, such as BPF related tools, drgn, etc.

For non-bcachefs developers, who knows what those statistics mean?

You can use BPF or drgn to traverse in advance to get the address of the
bcachefs shrinker structure, and then during OOM, find the bcachefs
private structure through the shrinker->private_data member, and then
dump the bcachefs private data. Is there any problem with this?

Thanks,
Qi

For qemu already have of_root as there is still a device tree, it's just
used to pass some stuff to EDK2 I think. I was carrying the Frank's
series adding a bare device tree, it's just not doing anything on these
systems

I used Clements patch to add the pci root (cleaned up a bit to
match the style of your series more closely).

However, my interest is in ACPI based systems, not DT based ones.

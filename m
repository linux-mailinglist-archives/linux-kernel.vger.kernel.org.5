To be honest, I'm not sure if anything needs to be done along the
lines of this patch right now or even at all.

The only concern here would be that some new drivers would include
thermal_core.h while we were waiting for the remaining existing
abusers to be fixed, but since this hasn't happened for the last 6
months, I'm not worried.

It would be good to add a notice to thermal_core.h that this file is
for internal use in the thermal core only, though.

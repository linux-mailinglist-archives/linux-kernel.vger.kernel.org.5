Please note that other documents from Rockchip also exist.  Below is
a link to a screenshot from the Thermal developer guide, version 1.0,
which describes the whole thing further.  I believe it's obvious that
the thermal runaway is to be treated as a board-level feature.

To be fair, that version of the Thermal developer guide dates back to
2019, meaning that it technically applies to the RK3399, for example,
but the TSADC and reset circuitry design has basically remained the
same for the RK3588.

Please note that the TSADC is disabled in the RK3399 SoC dtsi, so having
it disabled in the RK3588(s) SoC dtsi would provide some consistency.
Though, the RK3399 still does it in a safe way, by moving the OPPs into
a separate dtsi file, named rk3399-opp.dtsi, which the board dts files
then include together with enabling the TSADC.

If you agree, let's employ the same approach for the RK3588(s), by 
having
the its OPPs defined in a separate file, named rk3588s-opp.dtsi, etc.

Of course, but the thermal shutdown is obviously a board-level feature,
which I described further above.

Please see my comments above, regarding the separate dtsi for the OPPs.
I think it's a win-win, and I hope you'll agree.

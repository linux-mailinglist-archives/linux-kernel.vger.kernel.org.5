No where near that many! - but its impossible for me to know. MPAM is a bag of bits, its
up to Arm's partners what they build with it. MPAM does have 8 bit counter id,s but there
are only two defined so far. The other fields depend on what people build.

The problem here is the folk who generate the ACPI tables have seen a 32bit field, and
generated a value based on the topology so they know its always unique - instead of taking
a description of the two or three caches that need an ID.

I'll have a go at compressing them into a smaller range in the kernel. As no other
platform preserves a hardware ID here, I don't think its a major loss to re-create these.
It's certainly going to be less ugly to user-space!


Thanks,

James

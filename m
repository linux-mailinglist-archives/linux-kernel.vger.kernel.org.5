Not sure. It seems like there was a 24 hour delay for 18.1.4 if I am
reading GitHub's release JSON correctly:

$ gh -R llvm/llvm-project release view --json assets,createdAt,tagName llvmorg-18.1.4 | python3 -c "import json, sys

llvm_json = json.load(sys.stdin)

llvm_tag_date = llvm_json['createdAt']
llvm_tag_name = llvm_json['tagName']

print(f'\n{llvm_tag_name} was made at {llvm_tag_date}\n')

for asset in llvm_json['assets']:
    if (asset_name := asset['name']).endswith('.src.tar.xz'):
        asset_upload_date = asset['createdAt']
        print(f'{asset_name} was uploaded at {asset_upload_date}')"

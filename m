But there are VA pages for the enclave at that moment. So it can be  
candidate for OOM victim.

No, at a given instant when OOM happens, "active" enclave's SECS may not  
be in EPC, but lots of VAs.

OOM := "no reclaimable pages left in the cgroup to reclaim and total usage  
is still at/near limit".

You can't assume the requesting enclave's SECS is in unreclaimable list  
either. Think the request is from #PF in the scenario we fixed the NULL  
pointer of SECS by reloading it.

If we know for sure SECS will always be in EPC, thus tracked in  
unreclaimables, then we probably can do it (see below).
I hope the reason given above is clear.

Only mentioned it as a kind of constraints impacting current design.

Another potential alternative: we don't reclaim SECS either until OOM and  
only track SECS pages for cgroups. But that would change current behavior.  
And I'm not sure about other consequences, e.g., enclaves theoretically  
can allocate pages (including VA pages) in different cgroups/processes, so  
we may still end up tracking all VA pages for cgroups or we track SECS  
page in all cgroups in which enclave allocated any pages. Let me know your  
thoughts.

Thank you!

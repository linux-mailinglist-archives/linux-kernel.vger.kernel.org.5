I was asking about default reclaim behavior not madvise here.

As already pointed out in other reply, make sure you explain this so
that we, who are not active in mobile field, can understand the metric,
how it is affected by the tooling relying on this interface.

cgroup v1 is in maintenance mode and new extension would need to pass
even a higher feasibility test than v2 based interface. Also make sure
that you are testing the current upstream kernel.

Also let me stress out that you are proposing an extension to the user
visible API and we will have to maintain that for ever. So make sure
your justification is solid and understandable.
